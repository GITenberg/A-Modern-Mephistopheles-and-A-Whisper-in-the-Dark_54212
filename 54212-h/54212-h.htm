  <h2 class='c004'>I.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>Without, a midwinter twilight, where
wandering snowflakes eddied in the bitter
wind between a leaden sky and frost-bound
earth.</p>

<p class='c006'>Within, a garret; gloomy, bare, and cold as the
bleak night coming down.</p>

<hr class='c007' />

<p class='c006'>A haggard youth knelt before a little furnace,
kindling a fire, with an expression of quiet desperation
on his face, which made the simple
operation strange and solemn.</p>

<p class='c006'>A pile of manuscript lay beside him, and in
the hollow eyes that watched the white leaves
burn was a tragic shadow, terrible to see,—for he
was offering the first-born of heart and brain as
sacrifice to a hard fate.</p>

<p class='c006'>Slowly the charcoal caught and kindled, while
a light smoke filled the room. Slowly the
youth staggered up, and, gathering the torn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>sheets, thrust them into his bosom, muttering
bitterly, “Of all my hopes and dreams, my weary
work and patient waiting, nothing is left but this.
Poor little book, we’ll go together, and leave no
trace behind.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Throwing himself into a chair, he laid his head
down upon the table, where no food had been for
days, and, closing his eyes, waited in stern silence
for death to come and take him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nothing broke the stillness but the soft crackle
of the fire, which began to flicker with blue
tongues of flame, and cast a lurid glow upon the
motionless figure with its hidden face. Deeper
grew the wintry gloom without, ruddier shone
the fateful gleam within, and heavy breaths began
to heave the breast so tired of life.</p>

<p class='c006'>Suddenly a step sounded on the stair, a hand
knocked at the door, and when no answer came,
a voice cried, “Open!” in a commanding tone,
which won instant obedience, and dispelled the
deathful trance fast benumbing every sense.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The devil!” ejaculated the same imperious
voice, as the door swung open, letting a cloud of
noxious vapor rush out to greet the new-comer,—a
man standing tall and dark against the outer
gloom.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Who is it? Oh! come in!” gasped the youth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>falling back faint and dizzy, as the fresh air
smote him in the face.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I cannot, till you make it safe for me to enter.
I beg pardon if I interrupt your suicide; I
came to help you live, but if you prefer the other
thing, say so, and I will take myself away again,”
said the stranger, pausing on the threshold, as
his quick eye took in the meaning of the scene
before him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“For God’s sake, stay!” and, rushing to the
window, the youth broke it with a blow, caught
up the furnace, and set it out upon the snowy
roof, where it hissed and glowed like an evil
thing, while he dragged forth his one chair, and
waited, trembling, for his unknown guest to enter.</p>

<p class='c006'>“For my own sake, rather: I want excitement;
and this looks as if I might find it here,” muttered
the man with a short laugh, as he watched
the boy, calmly curious, till a gust of fresh air
swept through the room, making him shiver with
its sharp breath.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Jasper Helwyze, at your service,” he added
aloud, stepping in, and accepting courteously the
only hospitality his poor young host could offer.</p>

<p class='c006'>The dim light and shrouding cloak showed
nothing but a pale, keen face, with dark penetrating
eyes, and a thin hand, holding a paper on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>which the youth recognized the familiar words,
“Felix Canaris.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“My name! You came to help me? What
good angel sent you, sir?” he exclaimed, with a
thrill of hope,—for in the voice, the eye, the
hand that held the card with such tenacious
touch, he saw and felt the influence of a stronger
nature, and involuntarily believed in and clung
to it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Your bad angel, you might say, since it was
the man who damned your book and refused the
aid you asked of him,” returned the stranger, in
a suave tone, which contrasted curiously with the
vigor of his language. “A mere chance led me
there to-day, and my eye fell upon a letter lying
open before him. The peculiar hand attracted
me, and Forsythe, being in the midst of your
farewell denunciation, read it out, and told your
story.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And you were laughing at my misery while
I was making ready to end it?” said the youth,
with a scornful quiver of the sensitive lips that
uttered the reproach.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We all laugh at such passionate folly when
we have outlived it. You will, a year hence; so
bear no malice, but tell me briefly if you can
forget poetry, and be content with prose for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>time. In plain words, can you work instead of
dream?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I can.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good! then come to me for a month. I have
been long from home, and my library is neglected;
I have much for you to do, and believe you are
the person I want, if Forsythe tells the truth.
He says your father was a Greek, your mother
English, both dead, and you an accomplished,
ambitious young man who thinks himself a
genius, and will not forgive the world for doubting
what he has failed to prove. Am I right?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Quite right. Add also that I am friendless,
penniless, and hopeless at nineteen.”</p>

<p class='c006'>A brief, pathetic story, more eloquently told by
the starvation written on the pinched face, the
squalor of the scanty garments, and the despair
in the desperate eye, than by the words uttered
with almost defiant bluntness.</p>

<p class='c006'>The stranger read the little tragedy at a
glance, and found the chief actor to his taste;
for despite his hard case he possessed beauty,
youth, and the high aspirations that die hard,—three
gifts often peculiarly attractive to those
who have lost them all.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wait a month, and you may find that you
have earned friends, money, and the right to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>hope again. At nineteen, one should have
courage to face the world, and master it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Show me how, and I <em>will</em> have courage. A
word of sympathy has already made it possible
to live!” and, seizing the hand that offered help,
Canaris kissed it with the impulsive grace and
ardor of his father’s race.</p>

<p class='c006'>“When can you come to me?” briefly demanded
Helwyze, gathering his cloak about him as
he rose, warned by the waning light.</p>

<p class='c006'>“At once, to-night, if you will! I possess
nothing in the world but the poor clothes that
were to have been my shroud, and the relics of
the book with which I kindled my last fire,”
answered the youth, with eager eyes, and an
involuntary shiver as the bitter wind blew in
from the broken window.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come, then, else a mightier master than I
may claim you before dawn, for it will be an
awful night. Put out your funeral pyre, Canaris,
wrap your shroud well about you, gather up your
relics, and follow me. I can at least give you a
warmer welcome than I have received,” added
Helwyze, with that sardonic laugh of his, as he
left the room.</p>

<p class='c006'>Before he had groped his slow way down the
long stairs the youth joined him, and side by
side they went out into the night.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>A month later the same pair sat together in
a room that was a dream of luxury. A noble
library, secluded, warm, and still; the reposeful
atmosphere that students love pervaded it; rare
books lined its lofty walls: poets and philosophers
looked down upon their work with immortal
satisfaction on their marble countenances;
and the two living occupants well became their
sumptuous surroundings.</p>

<p class='c006'>Helwyze leaned in a great chair beside a table
strewn with books which curiously betrayed the
bent of a strong mind made morbid by physical
suffering. Doré’s “Dante” spread its awful pages
before him; the old Greek tragedies were scattered
about, and Goethe’s “Faust” was in his hand.
An unimpressive figure at first sight, this frail-looking
man, whose age it would be hard to tell;
for pain plays strange pranks, and sometimes
preserves to manhood a youthful delicacy in return
for the vigor it destroys. But at a second
glance the eye was arrested and interest aroused,
for an indefinable expression of power pervaded
the whole face, beardless, thin-lipped, sharply
cut, and colorless as ivory. A stray lock or
two of dark hair streaked the high brow, and
below shone the controlling feature of this singular
countenance, a pair of eyes, intensely black,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>and so large they seemed to burden the thin
face. Violet shadows encircled them, telling of
sleepless nights, days of languor, and long years
of suffering, borne with stern patience. But in
the eyes themselves all the vitality of the man’s
indomitable spirit seemed concentrated, intense
and brilliant as a flame, which nothing could
quench. By turns melancholy, meditative, piercing,
or contemptuous, they varied in expression
with startling rapidity, unless mastered by an
art stronger than nature; attracting or repelling
with a magnetism few wills could resist.</p>

<p class='c006'>Propping his great forehead on his hand, he
read, motionless as a statue, till a restless movement
made him glance up at his companion,
and fall to studying him with a silent scrutiny
which in another would have softened to admiration,
for Canaris was scarcely less beautiful
than the Narcissus in the niche behind him.</p>

<p class='c006'>An utter contrast to his patron, for youth
lent its vigor to the well-knit frame, every limb
of which was so perfectly proportioned that
strength and grace were most harmoniously
blended. Health glowed in the rich coloring
of the classically moulded face, and lurked in the
luxuriant locks which clustered in glossy rings
from the low brow to the white throat. Happiness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>shone in the large dreamy eyes and smiled
on the voluptuous lips; while an indescribable
expression of fire and force pervaded the whole,
redeeming its beauty from effeminacy.</p>

<p class='c006'>A gracious miracle had been wrought in that
month, for the haggard youth was changed into
a wonderfully attractive young man, whose natural
ease and elegance fitted him to adorn that
charming place, as well as to enjoy the luxury
his pleasure-loving senses craved.</p>

<p class='c006'>The pen had fallen from his hand, and lying
back in his chair with eyes fixed on vacancy, he
seemed dreaming dreams born of the unexpected
prosperity which grew more precious with each
hour of its possession.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Youth surely <em>is</em> the beauty of the devil, and
that boy might have come straight from the
witches’ kitchen and the magic draught,”
thought Helwyze, as he closed his book, adding
to himself with a daring expression, “Of all the
visions haunting his ambitious brain not one is
so wild and wayward as the fancy which haunts
mine. Why not play fate, and finish what I have
begun?”</p>

<p class='c006'>A pause fell, more momentous than either
dreamed; then it was abruptly broken.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Felix, the time is up.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>“It is, sir. Am I to go or stay?” and Canaris
rose, looking half-bewildered as his brilliant
castles in the air dissolved like mist before a
sudden gust.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Stay, if you will; but it is a quiet life for
such as you, and I am a dull companion. Could
you bear it for a year?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“For twenty! Sir, you have been most kind
and generous, and this month has seemed like
heaven, after the bitter want you took me from.
Let me show gratitude by faithful service, if I
can,” exclaimed the young man, coming to stand
before his master, as he chose to call his benefactor,
for favors were no burden yet.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No thanks, I do it for my own pleasure. It
is not every one who can have antique beauty
in flesh and blood as well as marble; I have a
fancy to keep my handsome secretary as the one
ornament my library lacked before.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Canaris reddened like a girl, and gave a disdainful
shrug; but vanity was tickled, nevertheless,
and he betrayed it by the sidelong
glance he stole towards the polished doors of
glass reflecting his figure like a mirror.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nay, never frown and blush, man; ‘beauty is
its own excuse for being,’ and you may thank
the gods for yours, since but for that I should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>send you away to fight your dragons single-handed,”
said Helwyze, with a covert smile, adding,
as he leaned forward to read the face which
could wear no mask for him, “Come, you shall
give me a year of your liberty, and I will help
you to prove Forsythe a liar.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You will bring out my book?” cried Canaris,
clasping his hands as a flash of joy irradiated
every lineament.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why not? and satisfy the hunger that torments
you, though you try to hide it. I cannot
promise success, but I <em>can</em> promise a fair trial;
and if you stand the test, fame and fortune
will come together. Love and happiness you
can seek for at your own good pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You have divined my longing. I do hunger
and thirst for fame; I dream of it by night, I
sigh for it by day; every thought and aspiration
centres in that desire; and if I did not still
cling to that hope, even the perfect home you
offer me would seem a prison. I <em>must</em> have it;
the success men covet and admire, suffer and
strive for, and die content if they win it only for
a little time. Give me this and I am yours, body
and soul; I have nothing else to offer.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Canaris spoke with passionate energy, and
flung out his hand as if he cast himself at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>other’s feet, a thing of little worth compared to
the tempting prize for which he lusted.</p>

<p class='c006'>Helwyze took the hand in a light, cold clasp,
that tightened slowly as he answered with the
look of one before whose will all obstacles go
down,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Done! Now show me the book, and let us
see if we cannot win this time.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>II.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>Nothing stirred about the vine-clad villa,
except the curtains swaying in the balmy
wind, that blew up from a garden where mid-summer
warmth brooded over drowsy flowers
and whispering trees. The lake below gleamed
like a mirror garlanded about with water-lilies,
opening their white bosoms to the sun. The
balcony above burned with deep-hearted roses
pouring out their passionate perfume, as if in
rivalry of the purple heliotrope, which overflowed
great urns on either side of the stone steps.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nothing broke the silence but the breezy
rustle, the murmurous lapse of waters upon a
quiet shore, and now and then the brief carol of
a bird waking from its noontide sleep. A hammock
swung at one end of the balcony, but it
was empty; open doors showed the wide hall
tenanted only by statues gleaming, cool and coy,
in shadowy nooks; and the spirit of repose
seemed to haunt the lovely spot.</p>

<p class='c006'>For an hour the sweet spell lasted; then it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>broken by the faint, far-off warble of a woman’s
voice, which seemed to wake the sleeping palace
into life; for, as if drawn by the music, a young
man came through the garden, looking as Ferdinand
might, when Ariel led him to Miranda.</p>

<p class='c006'>Too beautiful for a man he was, and seemed to
protest against it by a disdainful negligence of
all the arts which could enhance the gracious
gift. A picturesque carelessness marked his
costume, the luxuriant curls that covered his
head were in riotous confusion; and as he came
into the light he stretched his limbs with the
graceful abandon of a young wood-god rousing
from his drowse in some green covert.</p>

<p class='c006'>Swinging a knot of lilies in his hand, he sauntered
up the long path, listening with a smile, for
as the voice drew nearer he recognized both song
and singer.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Little Gladys must not see me, or she will
end her music too soon,” he whispered to himself;
and, stepping behind the great vase, he peered
between the plumy sprays to watch the coming
of the voice that made his verses doubly melodious
to their creator’s ear.</p>

<p class='c006'>Through the shadowy hall there came a slender
creature in a quaint white gown, who looked as
if she might have stepped down from the marble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Hebe’s pedestal; for there was something wonderfully
virginal and fresh about the maidenly
figure with its deep, soft eyes, pale hair, and
features clearly cut as a fine cameo. Emerging
from the gloom into a flood of sunshine, which
touched her head with a glint of gold, and brought
out in strong relief the crimson cover of the
book, held half-closed against her breast, she
came down the steps, still singing softly to herself.</p>

<p class='c006'>A butterfly was sunning its changeful wings
on the carved balustrade, and she paused to watch
it, quite unconscious of the picture she made, or
the hidden observer who enjoyed it with the delight
of one whose senses were keenly alive to
all that ministers to pleasure. A childish act
enough, but it contrasted curiously with the words
she sung,—fervid words, that seemed to drop
lingeringly from her lips as if in a new language;
lovely, yet half learned.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Pretty thing! I wish I could sketch her as
she stands, and use her as an illustration to that
song. No nightingale ever had a sweeter voice
for a love-lay than this charming girl,” thought
the flattered listener, as, obeying a sudden impulse,
he flung up the lilies, stepped out from his
ambush, and half-said, half-sung, as he looked up
with a glance of mirthful meaning,—</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c000'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>“Like a high-born maiden</div>
      <div class='line in12'>In a palace tower,</div>
      <div class='line in10'>Soothing her love-laden</div>
      <div class='line in12'>Soul in secret hour,</div>
      <div class='line'>With music sweet as love which overflows her bower.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The flowers dropped at her feet, and, leaning
forward with the supple grace of girlhood, she
looked down to meet the dangerous dark eyes,
while her own seemed to wake and deepen with
a sudden light as beautiful as the color which
dawned in her innocent face. Not the quick red
of shame, nor the glow of vanity, but a slow, soft
flush like the shadow of a rosy cloud on snow. No
otherwise disconcerted, she smiled back at him,
and answered with unexpected aptness, in lines
that were a truer compliment than his had
been,—</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c000'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'>“Like a poet hidden</div>
      <div class='line in12'>In the light of thought,</div>
      <div class='line in10'>Singing hymns unbidden,</div>
      <div class='line in12'>Till the world is wrought</div>
      <div class='line'>To sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It was this charm of swift and subtle sympathy
which made the girl seem sometimes like the
embodied spirit of all that was most high and
pure in his own wayward but aspiring nature.
And this the spell that drew him to her now,
glad to sun himself like the butterfly in the light
of eyes so clear and candid, that he could read
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>therein the emotions of a maiden heart just
opening to its first, half-conscious love.</p>

<p class='c006'>Springing up the steps, he said with the
caressing air as native to him as his grace of
manner. “Sit here and weave a pretty garland
for your hair, while I thank you for making my
poor verses beautiful. Where did you find the
air that fits those words so well?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It came itself; as the song did, I think,” she
answered simply, as she obeyed him, and began
to braid the long brown stems, shaping a chaplet
fit for Undine.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah! you will never guess how that came!”
he said, sitting at her feet to watch the small
fingers at their pretty work. But though his
eyes rested there, they grew absent; and he
seemed to fall into a reverie not wholly pleasant,
for he knit his brows as if the newly won laurel
wreath sat uneasily upon a head which seemed
made to wear it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Gladys watched him in reverential silence till
he became conscious of her presence again, and
gave her leave to speak, with a smile which had
in it something of the condescension of an idol
towards its devoutest worshipper.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Were you making poetry, then?” she asked,
with the frank curiosity of a child.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>“No, I was wondering where I should be now
if I had never made any;” and he looked at the
summer paradise around him with an involuntary
shiver, as if a chill wind had blown upon
him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Think rather what you will write next. It
is so lovely I want more, although I do not understand
all this,” touching the book upon her
knee with a regretful sigh.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Neither do I; much of it is poor stuff,
Gladys. Do not puzzle your sweet wits over it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is because you are so modest. People
say true genius is always humble.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then, I am not a true genius; for I am as
proud as Lucifer.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You may well be proud of such work as
this;” and she carefully brushed a fallen petal
from the silken cover.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But I am <em>not</em> proud of that. At times I
almost hate it!” exclaimed the capricious poet,
impetuously, then checked himself, and added
more composedly, “I mean to do so much better,
that this first attempt shall be forgotten.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think you will never do better; for this
came from your heart, without a thought of what
the world would say. Hereafter all you write
may be more perfect in form but less true in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>spirit, because you will have the fear of the
world, and loss of fame before your eyes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How can you know that?” he asked, wondering
that this young girl, so lately met, should
read him so well, and touch a secret doubt that
kept him idle after the first essay, which had
been a most flattering success.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nay, I do not know, I only feel as if it must
be so. I always sing best when alone, and the
thought of doing it for praise or money spoils
the music to my ear.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I feel as if it would be possible to do <em>any
thing</em> here, and forget that there is a world outside.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then it is not dull to you? I am glad, for I
thought it would be, because so many people
want you, and you might choose many gayer
places in which to spend your summer holiday.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have no choice in this; yet I was willing
enough to come. The first time is always
pleasant, and I am tired of the gayer places,”
he said, with a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>blasé</i></span> air that ill concealed how
sweet the taste of praise had been to one who
hungered for it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yet it must seem very beautiful to be so
sought, admired, and loved,” the girl said wistfully,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>for few of fortune’s favors had fallen into
her lap as yet.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is, and I was intoxicated with the wine of
success for a time. But after all, I find a bitter
drop in it, for there is always a higher step to
take, a brighter prize to win, and one is never
satisfied.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He paused an instant with the craving yet
despondent look poets and painters wear as they
labor for perfection in “a divine despair;” then
added, in a tone of kindly satisfaction which rung
true on the sensitive ear that listened,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“But all that nonsense pleases Helwyze, and
he has so few delights, I would not rob him of
one even so small as this, for I owe every thing
to him, you know.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do not know. May I?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You may; for I want you to like my friend,
and now I think you only fear him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mr. Canaris, I do not dislike your friend.
He has been most kind to me, I am grieved if
I seem ungrateful,” murmured Gladys, with a
vague trouble in her artless face, for she had no
power to explain the instinctive recoil which had
unconsciously betrayed itself.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hear what he did for me, and then it may
be easier to show as well as to feel gratitude;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>since but for him you would have had none of
these foolish rhymes to sing.”</p>

<p class='c006'>With a look askance, a quick gesture, and a
curious laugh, Canaris tossed the book into the
urn below, and the heliotrope gave a fragrant
sigh as it closed above the treasure given to its
keeping. Gladys uttered a little cry, but her
companion took no heed, for clasping his hands
about his knee he looked off into the bloomy
wilderness below as if he saw a younger self there,
and spoke of him with a pitiful sort of interest.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Three years ago an ambitious boy came to
seek his fortune in the great city yonder. He
possessed nothing but sundry accomplishments,
and a handful of verses which he tried to sell.
Failing in this hope after various trials, he grew
desperate, and thought to end his life like poor
Chatterton. No, not like Chatterton,—for this
boy was not an impostor.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Had he no friend anywhere?” asked
Gladys,—her work neglected while she listened
with intensest interest to the tale so tragically
begun.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He thought not, but chance sent him one
at the last hour, and when he called on death,
Helwyze came. It always seemed to me as if,
unwittingly, I conjured from the fire kindled to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>destroy myself a genie who had power to change
me from the miserable wretch I was, into the
happy man I am. For more than a year I have
been with him,—first as secretary, then <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>protégé</i></span>,
now friend, almost son; for he asks nothing
of me except such services as I love to
render, and gives me every aid towards winning
my way. Is not that magnificent generosity?
Can I help regarding him with superstitious
gratitude? Am I not rightly named Felix?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, oh yes! Tell me more, please. I
have led such a lonely life, that human beings
are like wonder-books to me, and I am never
tired of reading them.” Gladys looked with a
rapt expression into the face upturned to hers,
little dreaming how dangerous such lore might
be to her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then you should read Helwyze; he is a
romance that will both charm and make your
heart ache, if you dare to try him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I dare, if I may, because I would so gladly
lose my fear of him in the gentler feeling that
grows in me as I listen.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Canaris was irresistibly led on to confidences
he had no right to make, it was so pleasant to
feel that he had the power to move the girl by
his words, as the wind sways a leaf upon its delicate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>stem. A half-fledged purpose lurked in a
dark corner of his mind, and even while denying
its existence to himself, he yielded to its
influence, careless of consequences.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then I will go on and let compassion finish
what I have begun. Till thirty, Helwyze led a
wonderfully free, rich life, I infer from hints
dropped in unguarded moments,—for confidential
moods are rare. Every good gift was his,
and nothing to alloy his happiness, unless it was
the restless nature which kept him wandering
like an Arab long after most men have found
some ambition to absorb, or some tie to restrain,
them. From what I have gathered, I know that
a great passion was beginning to tame his unquiet
spirit, when a great misfortune came to
afflict it, and in an hour changed a life of entire
freedom to one of the bitterest bondage such a
man can know.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, what?” cried Gladys, as he artfully
paused just there to see her bend nearer, and her
lips part with the tremor of suspense.</p>

<p class='c006'>“A terrible fall; and for ten years he has
never known a day’s rest from pain of some
sort, and never will, till death releases him ten
years hence, perhaps, if his indomitable will
keeps him alive so long.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>“Alas, alas! is there no cure?” sighed
Gladys, as the violet eyes grew dim for very pity
of so hard a fate.</p>

<p class='c006'>“None.”</p>

<p class='c006'>A brief silence followed while the shadow of
a great white cloud drifted across the sky, blotting
out the sunshine for a moment.</p>

<p class='c006'>All the flowers strayed down upon the steps
and lay there forgotten, as the hands that held
them were clasped together on the girl’s breast,
as if the mere knowledge of a lot like this lay
heavy at her heart.</p>

<p class='c006'>Satisfied with his effect, the story-teller was
tempted to add another stroke, and went on
with the fluency of one who saw all things dramatically,
and could not help coloring them in
his own vivid fancy.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That seems very terrible to you, but in truth
the physical affliction was not so great as the
loss that tried his soul; for he loved ardently,
and had just won his suit, when the misfortune
came which tied him to a bed of torment for
some years. A fall from heaven to hell could
hardly have seemed worse than to be precipitated
from the heights of such a happiness to
the depths of such a double woe; for she, the
beautiful, beloved woman proved disloyal, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>left him lying there, like Prometheus, with the
vulture of remembered bliss to rend his heart.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Could he not forget her?” and Gladys trembled
with indignation at the perfidy which seemed
impossible to a nature born for self-sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He never will forget or forgive, although the
man she married well avenged him while he lived,
and bequeathed her a memory which all his gold
could not gild. <em>Her</em> fate is the harder now; for
the old love has revived, and Helwyze is dearer
than in his days of unmarred strength. He
knows it, but will not accept the tardy atonement;
for contempt has killed <em>his</em> love, and with
him there is no resurrection of the dead. A
very patient and remorseful love is hers: for she
has been humiliated in spirit, as he can never be,
by the bodily ills above which he has risen so
heroically that his courage has subdued the
haughtiest woman I ever met.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You know her, then?” and Gladys bent to
look into his face, with her own shadowed by an
intuition of the truth.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am afraid to listen any more. It is terrible
to know that such bitterness and grief lie hidden
in the hearts about me. Why did you
tell me this?” she demanded, shrinking from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>him, as if some prophetic fear had stepped between
them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why did I? Because I wished to make you
pity my friend, and help me put a little brightness
into his hard life. You can do it if you will,
for you soothe and please him, and few possess
the power to give him any comfort. He makes
no complaint, asks no pity, and insists on ignoring
the pain which preys upon him, till it grows
too great to be concealed; then shuts himself up
alone, to endure it like a Spartan. Forgive me
if in my eagerness I have said too much, and forget
whatever troubled you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Canaris spoke with genuine regret, and hoped
to banish the cloud from a face which had been
as placid as the lake below, till he disturbed it
by reflections that affrighted her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is easy to forgive, but not to forget, words
which cannot be unsaid. I was so happy here;
and now it is all spoilt. She was a new-made
friend, and very kind to me when I was desolate.
I shall seem a thankless beggar if I go away before
I have paid my debt as best I can. How
shall I tell her that I must?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of whom do you speak? I gave no name.
I thought you would not guess. Why must you
go, Gladys?” asked the young man, surprised to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>see how quickly she felt the chill of doubt, and
tried to escape obligation, when neither love nor
respect brightened it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I need give no name, because you know. It is
as well, perhaps, that I have guessed it. I ought
not to have been so content, since I am here
through charity. I must take up my life and
try to shape it for myself; but the world seems
very large now I am all alone.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She spoke half to herself, and looked beyond
the safe, secluded garden, to the gray mountains
whose rough paths her feet had trod before they
were led here to rest.</p>

<p class='c006'>Quick to be swayed by the varying impulses
which ruled him with capricious force, Canaris
was now full of pity for the trouble he had
wrought, and when she rose, like a bird startled
from its nest, he rose also, and, taking the hand
put out as if involuntarily asking help, he said
with regretful gentleness,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do not be afraid, we will befriend you. Helwyze
shall counsel and I will comfort, if we can.
I should not have told that dismal story; I will
atone for it by a new song, and you shall grow
happy in singing it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She hesitated, withdrew her hand, and looked
askance at him, as if one doubt bred others.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>An approaching footstep made her start, and
stand a moment with head erect, eye fixed, and
ear intent, like a listening deer, then whispering,
“It is she; hide me till I learn to look as if I
did not know!”—Gladys sprung down the steps,
and vanished like a wraith, leaving no token of
her presence but the lilies in the dust, for the
young man followed fleetly.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>A woman came into the balcony with a
swift step, and paused there, as if disappointed
to find it deserted. A woman in the
midsummer of her life, brilliant, strong, and
stately; clad in something dusky and diaphanous,
unrelieved by any color, except the pale
gold of the laburnum clusters, that drooped from
deep bosom and darkest hair. Pride sat on the
forehead, with its straight black brows, passion
slept in the Southern eyes, lustrous or languid
by turns, and will curved the closely folded lips
of vivid red.</p>

<p class='c006'>But over all this beauty, energy, and grace an
indescribable blight seemed to have fallen, deeper
than the loss of youth’s first freshness, darker
than the trace of any common sorrow. Something
felt, rather than seen, which gave her the
air of a dethroned queen; conquered, but protesting
fiercely, even while forced to submit to
some inexorable decree, whose bitterest pang
was the knowledge that the wrong was self-inflicted.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>As she stood there, looking down the green
vista, two figures crossed it. A smile curved
the sad mouth, and she said aloud, “Faust and
Margaret, playing the old, old game.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And Mephistopheles and Martha looking
on,” added a melodious voice, behind her, as
Helwyze swept back the half-transparent curtain
from the long window where he sat.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The part you give me is not a flattering
one,” she answered, veiling mingled pique and
pleasure with well-feigned indifference.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nor mine; yet I think they suit us both, in
a measure. Do you know, Olivia, that the accidental
reading of my favorite tragedy, at a certain
moment, gave me a hint which has afforded
amusement for a year.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You mean your fancy for playing Mentor to
that boy. A dangerous task for you, Jasper.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The danger is the charm. I crave excitement,
occupation; and what but something of
this sort is left me? Much saving grace in
charity, we are told; and who needs it more than
I? Surely I have been kinder to Felix than the
Providence which left him to die of destitution
and despair?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Perhaps not. The love of power is strong
in men like you, and grows by what it feeds on.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>If I am not mistaken, this whim of a moment
has already hardened into a purpose which will
mould his life in spite of him. It is an occupation
that suits your taste, for you enjoy his
beauty and his promise; you like to praise and
pamper him till vanity and love of pleasure wax
strong, then you check him with an equal satisfaction,
and find excitement in curbing his high
spirit, his wayward will. By what tie you hold
him I cannot tell; but I know it must be something
stronger than gratitude, for, though he
chafes against the bond, he <em>dares</em> not break
it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah, that is my secret! What would you
not give if I would teach you the art of taming
men as I once taught you to train a restive
horse?”—and Helwyze looked out at her with
eyes full of malicious merriment.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You have taught me the art of taming a
woman; is not that enough?” murmured
Olivia, in a tone that would have touched any
man’s heart with pity, if with no tenderer emotion.</p>

<p class='c006'>But Helwyze seemed not to hear the reproach,
and went on, as if the other topic suited
his mood best.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I call Canaris my Greek slave, sometimes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>and he never knows whether to feel flattered or
insulted. His father was a Greek adventurer,
you know (ended tragically, I suspect), and but
for the English mother’s legacy of a trifle of
moral sense, Felix would be as satisfactory a
young heathen as if brought straight from ancient
Athens. It was this peculiar mixture of
unscrupulous daring and fitful virtue which
attracted me, as much as his unusual beauty
and undoubted talent. Money can buy almost
any thing, you know; so I bought my handsome
Alcibiades, and an excellent bargain I find
him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But when you tire of him, what then? You
cannot sell him again, nor throw him away, like
a book you weary of. Neither can you leave
him neglected in the lumber-room, with distasteful
statues or bad pictures. Affection, if you
have it, will not outlast your admiration, and I
have much curiosity to know what will become
of your ‘handsome Alcibiades’ then.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then, my cousin, I will give him to you, for
I have fancied of late that you rather coveted
him. You could not manage him now,—the
savage in him is not quite civilized yet,—but
wait a little, and I will make a charming plaything
for you. I know you will treat him kindly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>since it is truly said, Those who have served, best
know how to rule.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The sneer stung her deeply, for there was no
humiliation this proud woman had not suffered
at the hands of a brutal and unfaithful husband.
Pity was as bitter a draught to her as to the
man who thus cruelly reminded her of the long
bondage which had left an ineffaceable blight
upon her life. The wound bled inwardly, but
she retaliated, as only such a woman could.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Love is the one master who can rule and
bind without danger or disgrace. I shall remember
that, and when you give me Felix he
will find me a gentler mistress than I was ten
years ago—to you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The last words dropped from her lips as softly
as if full of tender reminiscence, but they pricked
pride, since they could not touch a relentless
heart. Helwyze betrayed it by the sombre fire
of his eye, the tone in which he answered.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And I will ask of you the only gift I care
to accept,—your new <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>protégée</i></span>, Gladys. Tell
me where you found her; the child interests
me much.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I know it;” and, stifling a pang of jealous
pain, Olivia obeyed with the docility of one in
whom will was conquered by a stronger power.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>“A freak took me to the hills in March. My
winter had been a vain chase after happiness,
and I wanted solitude. I found it where chance
led me,—in this girl’s home. A poor, bleak
place enough; but it suited me, for there were
only the father and daughter, and they left me
to myself. The man died suddenly, and no one
mourned, for he was a selfish tyrant. The girl
was left quite alone, and nearly penniless, but so
happy in her freedom that she had no fears. I
liked the courage of the creature; I knew how
she felt; I saw great capacity for something fine
in her. I said, ‘Come with me for a little, and
time will show you the next step.’ She came;
time has shown her, and the next step will take
her from my house to yours, unless I much mistake
your purpose.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Leaning in the low, lounging chair, Helwyze
had listened motionless, except that the fingers
of one thin hand moved fitfully, as if he played
upon some instrument inaudible to all ears but
his own. A frequent gesture of his, and most
significant, to any one who knew that his favorite
pastime was touching human heart-strings
with marvellous success in producing discords
by his uncanny skill.</p>

<p class='c006'>As Olivia paused, he asked in a voice as suave
as cold,—</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>“My purpose? Have I any?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You say she interests you, and you watch
her in a way that proves it. Have you not
already resolved to win her for your amusement,
by some bribe as cunning as that you gave
Canaris for his liberty?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have. You are a shrewd woman, Olivia.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yet she is not beautiful;” and her eye
vainly searched the inscrutable countenance,
that showed so passionless and pale against
the purple cushion where it leaned.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Pardon me, the loveliest woman I have seen
for years. A beautiful, fresh soul is most attractive
when one is weary of more material
charms. This girl seems made of spirit, fire,
and dew; a mixture rare as it is exquisite, and
the spell is all the greater because of its fine and
elusive quality. I promise myself much satisfaction
in observing how this young creature
meets the trials and temptations life and love
will bring her; and to do this she must be near
at hand.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Happy Gladys!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Olivia smiled a scornful smile, but folded her
arms to curb the rebellious swelling of her heart
at the thought of another woman nearer than
herself. She turned away as she spoke; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>Helwyze saw the quiver of her lips, and read
the meaning of the piercing glance she shot into
the garden, as if to find and annihilate that unconscious
rival.</p>

<p class='c006'>Content for the moment with the touch of
daily torture which was the atonement exacted
for past disloyalty, he lifted the poor soul from
despair to delight by the utterance of three
words, accompanied by a laugh as mirthless as
musical,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Happy Felix, rather.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is <em>he</em> to marry her?” and Olivia fronted him,
glowing with a sudden joy which made her
lovely as well as brilliant.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Who else?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yourself.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I!” and the word was full of a bitterness
which thrilled every nerve the woman had, for
an irrepressible regret wrung it from lips sternly
shut on all complaint, except to her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why not?” she cried, daring to answer with
impetuous warmth and candor. “What woman
would not be glad to serve you for the sake of
the luxury with which you would surround her,
if not for the love you might win and give, if
you chose?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Bah! what have I to do with love? Thank
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>Heaven my passions are all dead, else life would
be a hell, not the purgatory it is,” he said, glancing
at his wasted limbs, with an expression
which would have been pathetic, had it not been
defiant; for that long discipline of pain had failed
to conquer the spirit of the man, and it seemed
to sit aloof, viewing with a curious mixture of
compassion and contempt the slow ruin of the
body which imprisoned it.</p>

<p class='c006'>With an impulse womanly as winning, Olivia
plucked a wine-dark rose from the trellis nearest
her, and, bending towards him, laid it in his hand,
with a look and gesture of one glad to give all
she possessed, if that were possible.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Your love of beauty still survives, and is a
solace to you. Let me minister to it when I
can; and be assured I offer my little friend as
freely as I do my choicest rose.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thanks; the flower for me, the friend for
Felix. Young as he is, he knows how to woo,
and she will listen to his love-tale as willingly as
she did to the highly colored romance he was
telling her just now. You would soon find
her a burden, Olivia, and so should I, unless
she came in this way. We need do nothing
but leave the young pair to summer and seclusion;
they will make the match better and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>more quickly than we could. Then a month
for the honeymoon business, and all can be
comfortably settled before October frosts set
in.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You often say, where women are is discord;
yet you are planning to bring one into your
house in the most dangerous way. Have you
no fears, Jasper?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not of Gladys; she is so young, I can mould
her as I please, and that suits me. She will
become my house well, this tender, transparent
little creature, with her tranquil eyes, and the sincere
voice which makes truth sweeter than falsehood.
You must come and see her there; but
never try to alter her, or the charm will be destroyed.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You may be satisfied: but how will it be
with Felix? Hitherto your sway has been undivided,
now you must share it; for with all her
gentleness she is strong, and will rule him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And I, Gladys. Felix suits me excellently,
and it will only add another charm to the relation
if I control him through the medium of
another. My young lion is discovering his
power rapidly, and I must give him a Una before
he breaks loose and chooses for himself.
If matters must be complicated, I choose to do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>it, and it will occupy my winter pleasantly to
watch the success of this new combination.”</p>

<p class='c006'>While he talked, Helwyze had been absently
stripping leaf after leaf from the great rose, till
nothing but the golden heart remained trembling
on the thorny stem.</p>

<p class='c006'>Olivia had watched the velvet petals fall one
by one, feeling a sad sympathy with the ill-used
gift; yet, as the last leaf fluttered to the ground,
she involuntarily lifted up her hand to break
another, glad if even in the destruction of so
frail a thing he could find a moment’s pleasure.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, let them hang; their rich color pleases
best among the green; their cloying perfume is
too heavy for the house. A snowdrop, leaning
from its dainty sheath undaunted by March
winds, is more to my taste now,” he said, dropping
the relics of the rose, with the slow smile
which often lent such significance to a careless
word.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I cannot give you that: spring flowers are all
gone long ago,” began Olivia, regretfully.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nay, you give me one in Gladys; no spring
flower could be more delicate than she, gathered
by your own hand from the bleak nook where
you found her. It is the faint, vernal fragrance
of natures, coyly hidden from common eye and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>touch, which satisfies and soothes senses refined
by suffering.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yet you will destroy it, like the rose, in finding
out the secret of its life. I wondered why
this pale, cold innocence was so attractive to a
man like you. There was a time when you
would have laughed at such a fancy, and craved
something with more warmth and brilliancy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am wiser now, and live here, not here,” he
answered, touching first his forehead then his
breast, with melancholy meaning. “While my
brain is spared me I can survive the ossification
of all the heart I ever had, since, at best, it is
an unruly member. Almost as inconvenient as
a conscience; that, thank fortune, I never had.
Yes; to study the mysterious mechanism of
human nature is a most absorbing pastime, when
books weary, and other sources of enjoyment
are forbidden. Try it, and see what an exciting
game it becomes, when men and women are the
pawns you learn to move at will. Goethe’s boyish
puppet-show was but a symbol of the skill
and power which made the man the magician he
became.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“An impious pastime, a dearly purchased
fame, built on the broken hearts of women!” exclaimed
Olivia, walking to and fro with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>noiseless step and restless grace of a leopardess
pacing its cage.</p>

<p class='c006'>Helwyze neither seemed to see nor hear her,
for his gloomy eyes stared at a little bird tilting
on a spray that swung in the freshening wind,
and his thoughts followed their own path.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Pale, cold innocence.’ It <em>is</em> curious that it
should charm me. A good sign, perhaps; for
poets tell us that fallen angels sigh for the heaven
they have lost, and try to rise again on the wings
of spirits stronger and purer than themselves.
Would they not find virtue insipid after a fiery
draught of sin? Did not Paradise seem a little
dull to Dante, in spite of Beatrice? I wish I
knew.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is it for this that you want the girl’s help?”
asked Olivia, pausing in her march to look at
him. “I shall wait with interest to see if she
lifts you up to sainthood, or you drag her down
to your level, where intellect is God, conscience
ignored, and love despised. Unhappy Gladys! I
should have said, because I cannot keep her from
you, if I would; and in your hands she will be as
helpless as the dumb creatures surgeons torture,
that they may watch a living nerve, count the
throbbing of an artery, or see how long the poor
things will live bereft of some vital part. Let
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>the child alone, Jasper, or you will repent of
it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Upon my word, Olivia, you are in an ominously
prophetic mood. I hear a carriage; and,
as I am invisible to all eyes but your gifted
ones, pardon me if I unceremoniously leave the
priestess on her tripod.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And the curtain dropped between them as
suddenly as it had been lifted, depriving the
woman of the one troubled joy of her life,—companionship
with him.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>IV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>“Felix, are you asleep?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, sir, only resting.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Have you been at work?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Decidedly; I rowed across the lake and
back.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Alone?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Gladys went with me, singing like a mermaid
all the way.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Both men were lounging in the twilight; but
there was a striking difference in their way Of
doing it. Canaris lay motionless on a couch, his
head pillowed on his arms, enjoying the luxury
of repose, with the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>dolce far niente</i></span> only possible
to those in whose veins runs Southern blood.
Helwyze leaned in a great chair, which looked a
miracle of comfort; but its occupant stirred restlessly,
as if he found no ease among its swelling
cushions; and there was an alert expression in
his face, betraying that the brain was at work on
some thought or purpose which both absorbed
and excited.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>A pause followed the brief dialogue, during
which Canaris seemed to relapse into his delicious
drowse, while Helwyze sat looking at him
with the critical regard one bestows on a fine
work of art. Yet something in the spectacle
of rest he could not share seemed to annoy him;
for, suddenly turning up the shaded lamp upon
his table, he dispelled the soft gloom, and broke
the silence.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have a request to make. May I trouble
you to listen?”</p>

<p class='c006'>There was a tone of command in the courteously
worded speech, which made Canaris sit
erect, with a respectful—</p>

<p class='c006'>“At your service, sir.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wish you to marry,” continued Helwyze,
with such startling abruptness that the young
man gazed at him in mute amazement for a
moment. Then, veiling his surprise by a laugh,
he asked lightly,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Isn’t it rather soon for that, sir? I am hardly
of age.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Geniuses are privileged; and I am not aware
of any obstacle, if <em>I</em> am satisfied,” answered Helwyze,
with an imperious gesture, which seemed
to put aside all objections.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you seriously mean it, sir?”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>“I do.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But why such haste?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Because it is my pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I will not give up my liberty so soon,” cried
the young man, with a mutinous flash of the
eye.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I thought you had already given it up. If
you choose to annul the agreement, do it, and
go. You know the forfeit.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I forgot this possibility. Did I agree to obey
in all things?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It was so set down in the bond. Entire
obedience in return for the success you coveted.
Have I failed in my part of the bargain?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, sir; no.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then do yours, or let us cancel the bond, and
part.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How can we? What can I do without you?
Is there no way but this?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“None.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Canaris looked dismayed,—and well he might,
for it seemed impossible to put away the cup he
had thirsted for, when its first intoxicating
draught was at his lips.</p>

<p class='c006'>Helwyze had spoken with peculiar emphasis,
and his words were full of ominous suggestion to
the listener’s ear; for he alone knew how much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>rebellion would cost him, since luxury and fame
were still dearer than liberty or honor. He sprung
up, and paced the room, feeling like some wild
creature caught in a snare.</p>

<p class='c006'>Helwyze, regardless of his chafing, went on
calmly, as if to a willing hearer, eying him vigilantly
the while, though now his own manner
was as persuasive as it had been imperative before.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I ask no more than many parents do, and
will give you my reasons for the demand, though
that was not among the stipulations.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“A starving man does not stop to weigh
words, or haggle about promises. I was desperate,
and you offered me salvation; can you
wonder that I clutched the only hand held out
to me?” demanded Canaris, with a world of
conflicting emotions in his expressive face, as
he paused before his master.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am not speaking of the first agreement,
that was brief as simple. The second bargain
was a more complicated matter. You were
not desperate then; you freely entered into it,
reaped the benefits of it, and now wish to
escape the consequences of your own act. Is
that fair?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How could I dream that you would exact
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>such obedience as this? I am too young; it is
a step that may change my whole life; I must
have time,” murmured Canaris, while a sudden
change passed over his whole face, his eye
fell before the glance bent on him, as the other
spoke.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It need not change your life, except to make
it freer, perhaps happier. Hitherto you have had
all the pleasure, now I desire my share. You
often speak of gratitude; prove it by granting
my request, and, in adding a new solace to my
existence, you will find you have likewise added
a new charm to your own.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is so sudden,—I do desire to show my
gratitude,—I have tried to do my part faithfully
so far,” began Canaris, as if a look, a word,
had tamed his high spirit, and enforced docility
sorely against his will.</p>

<p class='c006'>“So far, I grant that, and I thank you for the
service which I desire to lessen by the step
you decline to take. I have spoilt you for use,
but not for ornament. I still like to see you
flourish; I enjoy your success; I cannot free
you; but I <em>can</em> give you a mate, who will take
your place and amuse me at home, while you
sing and soar abroad. Is that sufficiently poetical
for a poet’s comprehension?” and Helwyze
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>smiled, that satiric smile of his, still watching
the young man’s agitated countenance.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But why need <em>I</em> marry? Why cannot”—there
Canaris hesitated, for he lacked the courage
to make the very natural suggestion Olivia had
done.</p>

<p class='c006'>Helwyze divined the question on his lips, and
answered it with stern brevity.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is impossible;” then added, with the
sudden softening of tone which made his voice
irresistibly seductive, “I have given one reason
for my whim: there are others, which affect you
more nearly and pleasantly, perhaps. Little
more than a year ago, your first book came out,
making you famous for a time. You have enjoyed
your laurels for a twelvemonth, and begin
to sigh for more. The world has petted you, as
it does any novelty, and expects to be paid for
its petting, else it will soon forget you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No fear of that!” exclaimed the other, with
the artless arrogance of youth.</p>

<p class='c006'>“If I thought you would survive the experiment,
I would leave you to discover what a
fickle mistress you serve. But frost would soon
blight your budding talent, so we will keep on
the world’s sunny side, and tempt the Muse, not
terrify her.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>Nothing could be smoother than the voice in
which these words were said; but a keen ear
would have detected an accent of delicate irony
in it, and a quick eye have seen that Canaris
winced, as if a sore spot had been touched.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I should think marriage would do that last,
most effectually,” he answered, with a scornful
shrug, and an air of great distaste.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not always: some geniuses are the better for
such bondage. I fancy you are one of them,
and wish to try the experiment. If it fails, you
can play Byron, to your heart’s content.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“A costly experiment for some one.” Canaris
paused in his impatient march, to look down
with a glance of pity at the dead lily still knotted
in his button-hole.</p>

<p class='c006'>Helwyze laughed at the touch of sentiment,—a
low, quiet laugh; but it made the young man
flush, and hastily fling away the faded flower,
whose pure loveliness had been a joy to him an
hour ago. With a half docile, half defiant look,
he asked coldly,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“What next, sir?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Only this: you have done well. Now, you
must do better, and let the second book be free
from the chief fault which critics found,—that,
though the poet wrote of love, it was evident he
had never felt it.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>“Who shall say that?” with sudden warmth.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I, for one. You know nothing of love, though
you may flatter yourself you do. So far, it has
been pretty play enough, but I will not have you
waste yourself, or your time. You need inspiration,
this will give it you. At your age, it is
easy to love the first sweet woman brought near
you, and almost impossible for any such to resist
your wooing. An early marriage will not only
give heart and brain a fillip, but add the new touch
of romance needed to keep up the world’s interest
in the rising star, whose mysterious advent
piques curiosity as strongly as his work excites
wonder and delight.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Composure and content had been gradually
creeping back into the listener’s mien, as a
skilful hand touched the various chords that
vibrated most tunefully in a young, imaginative,
ardent nature. Vivid fancy painted the
“sweet woman” in a breath, quick wit saw at
once the worldly wisdom of the advice, and ambition
found no obstacle impassable.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are right, sir, I submit; but I claim the
privilege of choosing my inspirer,” he said,
warily.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You have already chosen, if I am not much
mistaken. A short wooing, but a sure one; for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>little Gladys has no coquetry, and will not keep
you waiting for her answer.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Gladys is a child,” began Canaris, still hesitating
to avow the truth.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The fitter mate for you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But, sir, you are mistaken: I do not love
her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then, why teach her to love you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have not: I was only kind. Surely I
cannot be expected to marry every young girl
who blushes when I look at her,” he said, with
sullen petulance, for women had spoilt the handsome
youth, and he was as ungrateful as such
idols usually are.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then, who?—ah! I perceive; I had forgotten
that a boy’s first <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>tendresse</i></span> is too often for a
woman twice his age. May I trouble you?”
and Helwyze held up the empty glass with
which he had been toying while he talked.</p>

<p class='c006'>Among the strew of books upon the table at
his elbow stood an antique silver flagon, coolly
frosted over by the iced wine it held. This
Canaris obediently lifted; and, as he stooped
to fill the rosy bowl of the Venetian goblet,
Helwyze leaned forward, till the two faces were
so close that eye looked into eye, as he said,
in one swift sentence, “It was to win Olivia for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span><em>yourself</em>, then, that you wooed Gladys for <em>me</em>,
three hours ago?”</p>

<p class='c006'>The flagon was not heavy, but it shook in the
young man’s grasp, and the wine overflowed the
delicate glass, dyeing red the hand that held it.
One face glowed with shame and anger; the other
remained unmoved, except a baffling smile upon
the lips, that added, in mild reproach,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“My Ganymede has lost his skill; it is time I
filled his place with a neat-handed Hebe. Make
haste, and bring her to me soon.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mutely Canaris removed all traces of the
treacherous mishap, inwardly cursing his imprudent
confidences, wondering what malignant
chance brought within ear-shot one who rarely
left his own apartments at the other end of the
villa; and conscious of an almost superstitious
fear of this man, who read so surely, and dragged
to light so ruthlessly, hidden hopes and half-formed
designs.</p>

<p class='c006'>Vouchsafing no enlightenment, Helwyze
sipped the cool draught with an air of satisfaction,
continuing the conversation in a tone of
exasperating calmness.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Among other amusing fables with which
you beguiled poor Gladys, I think you promised
counsel and comfort. Keep your word, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>marry her. It is the least you can do, after
destroying her faith in the one friend she possessed.
A pleasant, but a dangerous pastime,
and not in the best taste; let me advise you to
beware of it in future.”</p>

<p class='c006'>There was a covert menace in the tone, a
warning in the significant grip of the pale
fingers round the glass, as if about to snap its
slender stem. Canaris was white now with
impotent wrath, and a thrill went through his
vigorous young frame, as if the wild creature
was about to break loose, and defy its captor.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the powerful eye was on him, with a
spark of fire in its depths, and controlled till
words, both sweet and bitter, soothed and won
him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I know that any breath of tenderness would
pass by Olivia as idly as the wind. You doubt
this, and a word will prove it. I am not a
tyrant, though I seem such; therefore you are
free to try your fate before you gratify my whim
and make Gladys happy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You think the answer will be ‘No?’” and
Canaris forgot every thing but the hope which
tempted, even while reason told him it was vain.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It always has been; it always will be, if I
know her.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>“Will be till <em>you</em> ask.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Rest easy; I am done with love.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But if she answers ‘Yes’?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then bid good-bye to peace,—and me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The answer startled the young lover, and
made him shrink from what he ardently desired;
for the new passion was but an enthralment of
the senses, and he knew it by the fine instinct
which permits such men to see and condemn
their lower nature, even while yielding to its
sway.</p>

<p class='c006'>But pride silenced doubt, and native courage
made it impossible to shun the trial or accept
the warning. His eye lit, his head rose, and he
spoke out manfully, though unconsciously he
wore the look of one who goes to lead a forlorn
hope,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“I shall try my fate to-night, and, if I fail, you
may do what you like with me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not a coward, thank Heaven!” mused Helwyze,
as he looked after the retreating figure
with the contemptuous admiration one gives to
any foolhardy enterprise bravely undertaken.
“He must have his lesson, and will be the tamer
for it, unless Olivia takes me at my word, and
humors the boy, for vengeance’ sake. That
would be a most dramatic complication, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>endanger my winter’s comfort seriously. Come,
suspense is a new emotion; I will enjoy it, and
meantime make sure of Gladys, or I may be left
in the lurch. A reckless boy and a disappointed
woman are capable of any folly.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>V.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>Helwyze folded black velvet <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>paletôt</i></span>
about him, stroked the damp hair off his
forehead, and, with hands loosely clasped behind
his back, went walking slowly through the quiet
house, to find the bright drawing-room and
breezy balcony already deserted.</p>

<p class='c006'>No sound of voice or step gave him the clew
he sought; and, pausing in the hall, he stood a
moment, his finger on his lip, wondering whither
Gladys had betaken herself.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not with them, assuredly. Dreaming in the
moonshine somewhere. I must look again.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Retracing his noiseless steps, he glanced here
and there with eyes which nothing could escape,
for trifles were significant to his quick wit; and
he found answers to unspoken queries in the
relics the vanished trio left behind them.
Olivia’s fan, flung down upon a couch, made him
smile, as if he saw her toss it there when yielding
half-impatiently to the entreaties of Canaris.
An ottoman, pushed hastily aside, told where the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>young lover sat, till he beguiled her out to listen
to the pleading which would wax eloquent and
bold under cover of the summer night. The
instrument stood open, a favorite song upon
the rack, but the glimmering keys were mute;
and the wind alone was singing fitfully. A
little hat lay in the window, as if ready to be
caught up in glad haste when the summons
came; but the dew had dimmed the freshness
of its azure ribbons, and there was a forlorn look
about the girlish thing, which told the story of a
timid hope, a silent disappointment.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where the deuce is the child?” and Helwyze
cast an ireful look about the empty room; for
motion wearied him, and any thwarting of his
will was dangerous. Suddenly his eye brightened,
and he nodded, as if well pleased; for
below the dark drapery that hung before an
arch, a fold of softest white betrayed the wearer.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now I have her!” he whispered, as if to
some familiar; and, parting the curtains, looked
down upon the little figure sitting there alone,
bathed in moonlight as purely placid as the face
turned on him when he spoke.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Might one come in? The house seems
quite deserted, and I want some charitable soul
to say a friendly word to me.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>“Oh, yes! What can I do, sir?” With the
look of a suddenly awakened child, Gladys rose
up, and involuntarily put out her hand as if to
heap yet more commodiously the pillows of the
couch which filled the alcove; then paused,
remembering what Canaris had told her of the
invalid’s rejection of all sympathy, and stood
regarding him with a shy, yet wistful glance,
which plainly showed the impulse of her tender
heart.</p>

<p class='c006'>Conscious that the surest way to win this
simple creature was by submitting to be comforted,—for
in her, womanly compassion was
stronger than womanly ambition, vanity, or
interest,—Helwyze shed a reassuring smile
upon her, as he threw himself down, exclaiming,
with a sigh of satisfaction, doubly effective from
one who so seldom owned the weariness that
oppressed him,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes: you shall make me comfortable, if you
kindly will; the heat exhausts me, and I cannot
sleep. Ah, this is pleasant! You have the gift
of piling pillows for weary heads, Gladys. Now,
let the moonlight make a picture of you, as it did
before I spoilt it; then I shall envy no man.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Pleased, yet abashed, the girl sank back into
her place on the wide window ledge, and bent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>her face over the blooming linden spray that lay
upon her lap, unconsciously making of herself
a prettier picture than before.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Musing here alone? Not sorrowfully, I
hope?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I never feel alone, sir, and seldom sorrowful.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘They never are alone that are accompanied
with noble thoughts;’ yet it would not be unnatural
if you felt both sad and solitary, so
young, so isolated, in this big, bad world of ours.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“A beautiful and happy world to me, sir.
Even loneliness is pleasant, because with it
comes—liberty.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The last word fell from her lips involuntarily;
and, with a wonderfully expressive gesture, she
lifted her arms as if some heavy fetter had
newly dropped away.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ardent emphasis and forceful action both
surprised and interested Helwyze, confirming
his suspicion that this girlish bosom hid a spirit
as strong as pure, capable of deep suffering,
exquisite happiness, heroic effort. His eye
shone, and he gave a satisfied nod; for his first
careless words had struck fire from the girl,
making his task easier and more attractive.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And how will you use this freedom? A
precious, yet a perilous, gift for such as you.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>“Can any thing so infinitely sweet and sacred
be dangerous? He who planted the longing
for it here, and gave it me when most needed,
will surely teach me how to use it. I have no
fear.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The bent head was erect now; the earnest face
turned full on Helwyze with such serene faith
shining in it, that the sneer died off his lips,
and something like genuine compassion touched
him, at the sight of such brave innocence tranquilly
confronting the unknown future.</p>

<p class='c006'>“May nothing molest, or make afraid. While
here, you are quite safe;—you <em>do</em>, then, think of
going?” he added, as a quick change arrested
him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do, sir, and soon. I only wait to see how,
and where.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was difficult to believe that so resolute a
tone could come into a voice so gentle, or that
lips whose shape was a smile could curl with
such soft scorn. But both were there; for the
memory of that other woman’s story embittered
even gratitude, since in the girl’s simple creed
disloyalty to love was next to disloyalty to God.</p>

<p class='c006'>Helwyze watched her closely, while his fingers
fell to tapping idly on the sofa scroll; and the
spark brightened under the lids that contracted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>with the intent expression of concentrated
sight.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Perhaps I can show you how and when.
May I?” he asked, assuming a paternal air,
which inwardly amused him much.</p>

<p class='c006'>Gladys looked, hesitated, and a shade of perplexity
dimmed the clear brightness of her glance,
as if vaguely conscious of distrust, and troubled
by its seeming causelessness.</p>

<p class='c006'>Helwyze saw it, and quickly added the magical
word which lulled suspicion, roused interest,
and irresistibly allured her fancy.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Pardon me; I should not have ventured to
speak, if Felix had not hinted that you began to
weary of dependence, as all free spirits must;
your own words confirm the hint; and I desired
to share my cousin’s pleasure in befriending, if
I might, one who can so richly repay all obligation.
Believe me, Gladys, your voice is a treasure,
which, having discovered, we want to share
between us.”</p>

<p class='c006'>If the moonlight had been daybreak, the girl’s
cheek could not have shown a rosier glow, as
she half-averted it to hide the joy she felt at
knowing Canaris had taken thought for her so
soon. Her heart fluttered with tender hopes
and fears, like a nestful of eager birds; and, forgetting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>doubt in delight, she yielded to the lure
held out to her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are most kind: I shall be truly grateful
if you will advise me, sir. Mrs. Surry has done
so much, I can ask no more, but rather hasten
to relieve her of all further care of me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She will be loth to lose you; but the friend
of whom I am about to speak needs you much,
and can give you what you love better even
than kindness,—independence.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes: that is what I long for! I will do any
thing for daily bread, if I may earn it honestly,
and eat it in freedom,” leaning nearer, with
clasped hands and eager look.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Could you be happy to spend some hours of
each day in reading, singing to, and amusing a
poor soul, who sorely needs such pleasant comforting?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I could. It would be very sweet to do it;
and I know how, excellently well, for I have had
good training. My father was an invalid, and I
his only nurse for years.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Fortunate for me in all ways,” thought Helwyze,
finding another reason for his purpose;
while Gladys, bee-like, getting sweetness out of
bitter-herbs, said to herself, “Those weary
years had their use, and are not wasted, as I
feared.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>“I think these duties will not be difficult nor
distasteful,” continued Helwyze, marking the
effect of each attraction, as he mentioned it with
modest brevity. “It is a quiet place; plenty of
rare books to read, fine pictures to study, and
music to enjoy; a little clever society, to keep
wits bright and enliven solitude; hours of leisure,
and entire liberty to use them as you will.
Would this satisfy you, Gladys, till something
better can be found?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Better!” echoed the girl, with the expression
of one who, having asked for a crust, is bidden
to a feast. “Ah, sir, it sounds too pleasant for
belief. I long for all these lovely things, but
never hoped to have them. Can I earn so
much happiness? Am I a fit companion for
this poor lady, who must need the gentlest nursing,
if she suffers in the midst of so much to
enjoy?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You will suit exactly; have no fear of that,
my good child. Just be your own happy, helpful
self, and you can make sunshine anywhere.
We will talk more of this when you have turned
it over in that wise young head of yours. Olivia
may have some more attractive plan to offer.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But Gladys shook “the wise young head”
with a decided air, as piquante as the sudden
resolution in her artless voice.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>“I shall choose for myself; your plan pleases
me better than any Mrs. Surry is likely to propose.
She says I must not work, but rest and
enjoy myself. I will work; I love it; ease steals
away my strength, and pleasure seems to dazzle
me. I must be strong, for I have only myself to
lean upon; I must see clearly, for my only guide
is my own conscience. I <em>will</em> think of your
most kind offer, and be ready to accept it whenever
you like to try me, sir.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thanks; I like to try you now, then; sit
here and croon some drowsy song, to show how
well you can lull wakeful senses into that blessed
oblivion called sleep.”</p>

<p class='c006'>As he spoke, Helwyze drew a low seat beside
the couch, and beckoned her to come and take
it; for she had risen as if to go, and he had no
mind to be left alone yet.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am so pleased you asked me to do this, for
it is my special gift. Papa was very stubborn,
but he always had to yield, and often called
me his ‘sleep compeller.’ Let me drop the
curtain first, light is so exciting, and draws the
insects. I shall keep them off with this pretty
fan, and you will find the faint perfume soothing.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Full of the sweetest good-will, Gladys leaned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>across the couch to darken the recess before
the lullaby began. But Helwyze, feeling in a
mood for investigation and experiment, arrested
the outstretched hand, and, holding it in his,
turned the full brilliance of his fine eyes on hers,
asking with most seductive candor,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Gladys, if <em>I</em> were the friend of whom we
spoke, would you come to me? You compel
truth as well as sleep, and I cannot deceive you,
while you so willingly serve me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>A moment she stood looking down into the
singular countenance before her with a curious
intentness in her own. A slight quickening of
the breath was all the sign she gave of a consciousness
of the penetrative glance fixed upon
her, the close grasp of his hand; otherwise unembarrassed
as a child, she regarded him with
an expression maidenly modest, but quite composed.
Helwyze keenly enjoyed these glimpses
of the new character with which he chose to
meddle, yet was both piqued and amused by
her present composure, when the mere name of
Felix filled her with the delicious shamefacedness
of a first love.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was a little curious that during the instant
the two surveyed each other, that, while the
girl’s color faded, a light red tinged the man’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>pale cheek, her eye grew clear and cold as his
softened, and the small hand seemed to hold
the larger by the mere contact of its passive
fingers.</p>

<p class='c006'>Slow to arrive, the answer was both comprehensive
and significant, but very brief, for three
words held it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Could I come?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Helwyze laughed with real enjoyment.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You certainly have the gift of surprises, if no
other, and it makes you charming, Gladys. I
fancied you as unsophisticated as if you were
eight, instead of eighteen, and here I find you
as discreet as any woman of the world,—more
so than many. Where did you learn it, child?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“From myself; I have no other teacher.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah! ‘instinct is a fine thing, my masters.’
<em>You</em> could not have a better guide. Rest easy,
little friend, the proprieties shall be preserved,
and you <em>can</em> come, if you decide to do me the
honor. My old housekeeper is a most decorous
and maternal creature, and into her keeping you
will pass. Felix pleased me well, but his time
is too valuable now; and, selfish as I am, I hesitate
to keep for my own comfort the man who
can charm so many. Will you come, and take
his place?”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>Helwyze could not deny himself the pleasure
of calling back the tell-tale color, for the blushes
of a chaste woman are as beautiful as the blooming
of a flower. Quickly the red tide rose, even
to the brow, the eyes fell, the hand thrilled, and
the steady voice faltered traitorously, “I could
not fill it, sir.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Still detaining her, that he might catch the
sweet aroma of an opening heart, Helwyze
added, as the last temptation to this young Eve,
whom he was beguiling out of the safe garden
of her tranquil girlhood into the unknown world
of pain and passion, waiting for womankind
beyond,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not for my own sake alone do I want you,
but for his. Life is full of perils for him, and he
needs a home. I cannot make one for him, except
in this way, for my house is my prison, and
he wearies of it naturally. But I <em>can</em> give it a
new charm, add a never-failing attraction, and
make it homelike by a woman’s presence. Will
you help me in this?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am not wise enough; Mrs. Surry is often
with you: surely she could make it homelike
far better than I,” stammered Gladys, chilled
by a sudden fear, as she remembered Canaris’
face as he departed with Olivia an hour ago.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“Pardon; that is precisely what she cannot
do. Such women weary while they dazzle, the
gentler sort win while they soothe. We shall
see less of her in future; it is not well for Felix.
Take pity on <em>me</em>, at least, and answer ‘Yes.’”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do, sir.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How shall I thank you?” and Helwyze
kissed the hand as he released it, leaving a little
thorn of jealousy behind to hoodwink prudence,
stimulate desire, and fret the inward peace that
was her best possession.</p>

<p class='c006'>Glad to take refuge in music, the girl assumed
her seat, and began to sing dreamily to
the slow waving of the green spray. Helwyze
feigned to be courting slumber, but from the
ambush of downcast lids he stole sidelong glances
at the countenance so near his own, that he could
mark the gradual subsiding of emotion, the slow
return of the repose which made its greatest
charm for him. And so well did he feign, that
presently, as if glad to see her task successfully
ended, Gladys stole away to the seclusion of her
own happy thoughts.</p>

<p class='c006'>Busied with his new plans and purposes, Helwyze
waited till his patience was rewarded by
seeing the face of Canaris appear at the window,
glance in, and vanish as silently as it came. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>one look was enough, and in that flash of time
the other read how the rash wooing had sped,
or thought he did, till Olivia came sweeping
through the room, flung wide the curtains, and
looked in with eyes as brilliant as if, they had
borrowed light of the fire-flies dancing there
without.</p>

<p class='c006'>“A fan, a cigarette, a scarlet flower behind
the ear, and the Spanish donna would be quite
perfect,” he said, surveying with lazy admiration
the richly colored face, which looked out from
the black lace, wrapped mantilla-wise over the
dark hair and whitely gleaming arms.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is the snowdrop gone? Then I will come
in, and hear how the new handmaid suits. I
saw her at her pleasing task.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“So well that I should like to keep her at it
long and often. Where is Felix?”</p>

<p class='c006'>His words, his look, angered Olivia, and she
answered with smiling ambiguity,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Out of his misery, at last.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Cruel as ever. I told him it would be so.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“On the contrary, I have been kind, as I
promised to be.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then his face belied him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Would it please you, if I had ventured to
forestall your promised gift, and accepted all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>Felix has to offer me, himself. I have my
whims, like you, and follow them as recklessly.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Helwyze knit his brows, but answered negligently,
“Folly never pleases me. It will be
amusing to see which tires first. I shall miss
him; but his place is already filled, and Gladys
has the charm of novelty.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You have spoken, then?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Forewarned, forearmed; I have her promise,
and Felix can go when he likes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Olivia paled, dropped her mask, and exclaimed
in undisguised alarm,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“There is no need: I have no thought of such
folly! My kindness to Felix was the sparing
him an avowal, which was simply absurd. A
word, a laugh, did it, for ridicule cures more
quickly and surely than compassion.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I thought so. Why try to fence with me,
Madama? you always get the worst of it,” and
Helwyze made the green twig whistle through
the air with a sharp turn of the wrist, as he rose
to go; for these two, bound together by a mutual
wrong, seldom met without bitter words, the
dregs of a love which might have blest them
both.</p>

<p class='c006'>He found Felix waiting for him, in a somewhat
haughty mood; Olivia having judged wisely that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>ridicule, though a harsh, was a speedy cure for
the youthful delusion, which had been fostered
by the isolation in which they lived, and the
ardent imagination of a poet.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You were right, sir. What are your commands?”
he asked, controlling disappointment,
pique, and unwillingness with a spirit that won
respect and forbearance even from Helwyze,
who answered with a cordial warmth, as rare
as charming,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have none: the completion of my wish I
leave to you. Consult your own time and
pleasure, and, when it is happily accomplished,
be assured I shall not forget that you have
shown me the obedience of a son.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Quick as a child to be touched, and won by
kindness, Canaris flushed with grateful feeling
and put out his hand impulsively, as he had
done when selling his liberty, for now he was
selling his love.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Forgive my waywardness. I <em>will</em> be guided
by you, for I owe you my life, and all the happiness
I have known in it. Gladys shall be a
daughter to you; but give me time—I must
teach myself to forget.”</p>

<p class='c006'>His voice broke as he stumbled over the last
words, for pride was sore, and submission hard.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>But Helwyze soothed the one and softened the
other by one of the sympathetic touches which
occasionally broke from him, proving that the
man’s heart, was not yet quite dead. Laying
his hand upon the young man’s shoulder, he
said in a tone which stirred the hearer deeply,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“I feared this pain was in store for you, but
could not save you from it. Accept the gentle
comforter I bring you, for I have known the
same pain, and <em>I</em> had no Gladys.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>VI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>So the days went by, fast and fair in outward
seeming, while an undercurrent of unquiet
emotion rolled below. Helwyze made no sign of
impatience, but silently forwarded his wish, by
devoting himself to Olivia; thereby making a
green oasis in the desert of her life, and leaving
the young pair to themselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>At first, Canaris shunned every one as much
as possible; but sympathy, not solitude, was the
balm he wanted, and who could give it him
so freely as Gladys? Her mute surprise and
doubt and grief at this capricious coldness, after
such winning warmth, showed him that the
guileless heart was already his, and added a
soothing sense of power to the reluctance and
regret which by turns tormented him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Irresistibly drawn by the best instincts of a
faulty but aspiring nature to that which was
lovely, true, and pure, he soon returned to
Gladys, finding in her sweet society a refreshment
and repose Olivia’s could never give him.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>Love he did not feel, but affection, the more helpful
for its calmness; confidence, which was given
again fourfold; and reverence, daily deepening as
time showed him the gentle strength and crystal
clarity of the spirit he was linking to his
own by ties which death itself could not
sever. But the very virtues which won, also
made him hesitate, though rash enough when
yielding to an attraction far less noble. A sense
of unworthiness restrained him, even when reluctance
had passed from resignation to something
like desire, and he paused, as one might,
who longed to break a delicate plant, yet delayed,
lest it should wither too quickly in his hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>Helwyze and Olivia watched this brief wooing
with peculiar interest. She, being happy herself,
was full of good hope for Gladys, and let her step,
unwarned, into the magic circle drawn around
her. He sat as if at a play, enjoying the pretty
pastoral enacted before him, content to let
“summer and seclusion” bring the young pair
together as naturally and easily as spring-time
mates the birds. Suspense gave zest to the
new combination, surprise added to its flavor,
and a dash of danger made it unusually attractive
to him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Canaris came to him one day, with a resolute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>expression on his face, which rendered it noble,
as well as beautiful.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sir, I will not do this thing; I dare not.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dare not! Is cowardice to be added to disobedience
and falsehood?” and Helwyze looked
up from his book with a contemptuous frown.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I will not be sneered out of my purpose; for
I never did a braver, better act than when I say
to you, ‘I dare not lie to Gladys.’”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What need of lying? Surely you love her
now, or you are a more accomplished actor than
I thought you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have tried,—tried too faithfully for her
peace, I fear; but, though I reverence her as an
angel, I do <em>not</em> love her as a woman. How can
I look into her innocent, confiding face, and tell
her,—she who is all truth,—that I love as she
does?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yet that is the commonest, most easily forgiven
falsehood a man can utter. Is it so hard
for <em>you</em> to deceive?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Quick and deep rose the hot scarlet to Canaris’s
face, and his eyes fell, as if borne down by the
emphasis of that one word. But the sincerity of
his desire brought courage even out of shame;
and, lifting his head with a humility more impressive
than pride or anger, he said, steadily,—</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>“If this truth redeems that falsehood, I shall,
at least, have recovered my own self-respect. I
never knew that I had lost it, till Gladys showed
me how poor I was in the virtue which makes
her what she is.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What conscientious qualm is this? Where
would this truth-telling bring you? How would
your self-respect bear the knowledge that you had
broken the girl’s heart? for, angel as you call
her, she has one, and you have stolen it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“At your bidding.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Long before I thought of it. Did you imagine
you could play with her, to pique Olivia,
without harm to Gladys? Is yours a face to
smile on a woman, day after day, and not teach
her to love? In what way but this <em>can</em> you atone
for such selfish thoughtlessness? Come, if we
are to talk of honor and honesty, do it fairly, and
not shift the responsibility of your acts upon my
shoulders.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Have I done that? I never meant to trouble
her. Is there no way out of it but this? Oh,
sir, I am not fit to marry her! What am I, to
take a fellow-creature’s happiness into my hands?
What have I to offer her but the truth in return
for her love, if I must take it to secure her
peace?”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>“If you offer the truth, you certainly <em>will</em> have
nothing else, and not even receive love in return,
perhaps; for her respect may go with all the
rest. If I know her, the loss of that would wound
her heart more deeply than the disappointment
your silence will bring her now. Think of this,
and be wise as well as generous in the atonement
you should make.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Bound, whichever way I look; for when I
meant to be kindest I am cruel.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Canaris stood perplexed, abashed, remorseful;
for Helwyze had the art to turn even his virtues
into weapons against him, making his new-born
regard for Gladys a reason for being falsely true,
dishonorably tender. The honest impulse suddenly
looked weak and selfish, compassion seemed
nobler than sincerity, and present peace better
than future happiness.</p>

<p class='c006'>Helwyze saw that he was wavering, and turned
the scale by calling to his aid one of the strongest
passions that rule men,—the spirit of rivalry,—knowing
well its power over one so young, so
vain and sensitive.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Felix, there must be an end of this; I am
tired of it. Since you are more enamoured of
truth than Gladys, choose, and abide by it. I
shall miss my congenial comrade, but I will not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>keep him if he feels my friendship slavery. I
release you from all promises: go your way, in
peace; I can do without you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>A daring offer, and Helwyze risked much in
making it; but he knew the man before him, and
that in seeming to set free, he only added another
link to the invisible chain by which he held him.
Canaris looked relieved, amazed, and touched, as
he exclaimed, incredulously,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you mean it, sir?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do; but in return for your liberty I claim
the right to use mine as I will.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Use it? I do not understand.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“To comfort Gladys.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You do not love her, and leave her doubly
forlorn, since you have given her a glimpse of
love. I must befriend her, as you will not; and
when she comes to me, as she has promised, if
she is happy, I shall keep her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“As <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>fille adoptive</i></span>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Canaris affirmed, not asked, this; and, in the
changed tone, the suspicious glance, Helwyze
saw that he had aimed well. With a smile that
was a sneer, he answered coldly,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hardly that: the paternal element is sadly
lacking in me; and, if it were not, I fear a man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>of forty could not adopt a girl of eighteen without
compromising her, especially one so lonely
and so lovely as poor little Gladys.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You will marry her? Yet when I hinted it,
you said, ‘Impossible!’”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I did; but then I did not know how helpful
she could be, how glad to love, how easy to be
won by kindness. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Ennui</i></span> drives one to do the
rashest things; and when you are gone, I shall
find it difficult to fill your place. ’Tis a pity to
tie the pretty creature to such a clod. But, if I
can help and keep her in no other way, I may do
it, remembering that her captivity would be a
short one; it should be my care that it was
a very light one while it lasted.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But she loves <em>me</em>!” exclaimed Canaris, with
jealous inconsistency.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I fear so; yet you reject her for a scruple.
Hearts are easily caught in the rebound; and
who will hold hers more gently than I? Olivia
will tell you I <em>can</em> be gentle when it suits me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The name stung Canaris, where pride was
sorest; and the thought, that this man could
take from him both the woman whom he loved
and the girl who loved him, roused an ignoble
desire to silence the noble one. He showed it
instantly, for his eye shot a quick glance at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>mirror; a smile that was almost insolent passed
over his face; and his air was full of the proud
consciousness of youth, health, comeliness, and
talent.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thanks for my freedom; I shall know how
to use it. Since I may tell Gladys the truth, I
do not dread her love so much; and will atone
generously, if I can. I think she will accept
poverty with me rather than luxury with you.
At least she shall have her choice.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well said. You will succeed, since you
possess all the gifts which win women except
wealth and”—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Stop! you shall <em>not</em> say it,” cried Canaris,
hotly. “Are you possessed of a devil, that you
torment me so?” He clenched his hands, and
walked fast through the room, as if to escape
from some fierce impulse.</p>

<p class='c006'>A certain, almost brutal, frankness characterized
the intercourse of these men at times;
for the tie between them was a peculiar one, and
fretted both, though both clung to it with strange
tenacity. With equal candor and entire composure
Helwyze answered the excited question.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We are all possessed, more or less; happy
the man who is master. My demon is a bad
one; for your intellectual devil is hard to manage,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>since he demands the best of us, and is not satisfied
or cheated as easily as some that are stronger,
yet less cunning. Yours is ambition,—an insatiable
fellow, who gives you no rest. I had a
fancy to help you rule him; but he proves less
interesting that I thought to find him, and is
getting to be a bore. See what you can do,
alone; only, when he gets the upper hand again,
excuse me from interfering: once is enough.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Canaris made no reply, but dashed out of the
room, as if he could bear no more, leaving Helwyze
to throw down his book, muttering impatiently,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Here is a froward favorite, and excitement
with a vengeance! He will not speak yet; for
with all his fire he is wary, and while he fumes I
must work. But how? but how?”</p>
<div class='pbb'>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>VII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>A storm raged all that night; but dawn
came up so dewy and serene, that the
world looked like a child waking after anger,
with happy smiles upon its lips, penitential tears
in its blue eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>Canaris was early astir, after a night as stormy
within as without, during which he had gone
through so many alternations of feeling, that,
weary and still undecided, he was now in the
mood to drift whithersoever the first eddy impelled
him. Straight to Gladys, it seemed; and,
being superstitious, he accepted the accident as
a good omen, following his own desire, and calling
it fate.</p>

<p class='c006'>Wandering in the loneliest, wildest spot of all
the domain, he came upon her as suddenly as if
a wish had brought her to the nook haunted for
both by pleasant memories. Dew-drenched her
feet, hatless her head; but the feet stood firmly
on the cliff which shelved down to the shore
below, and the upturned head shone bright
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>against the deep blue of the sky. Morning
peace dwelt in her eyes, morning freshness
glowed on her cheek, and her whole attitude
was one of unconscious aspiration, as she stood
there with folded hands and parted lips, drinking
in the storm-cooled breeze that blew vigorous
and sweet across the lake.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What are you doing here so early, little
dryad?” and Canaris paused, with an almost
irresistible desire to put out his arms and hold
her, lest she fly away, so airy was her perch,
so eager her look into the boundless distance
before her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Only being happy!” and she looked down
into his face with such tender and timid joy in
her own, he hardly had need to ask,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, Gladys?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Because of this,” showing a string of pearls
that hung from her hand, half-hidden among the
trailing bits of greenery gathered in her walk.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Who gave you that?” demanded Canaris,
eying it with undisguised surprise; for the
pearls were great, globy things, milk-white, and
so perfect that any one but Gladys would have
seen how costly was the gift.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Need you ask?” she said, blushing brightly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why not? Do you suspect me?”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>“You cannot deceive me by speaking roughly
and looking stern. Who but you would put
these in my basket without a word, and let me
find them there when I laid my work away
last night? I was so pleased, so proud, I could
not help keeping them, though far too beautiful
for me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Then Canaris knew who had done it; and his
hand tightened over the necklace, while his eye
went towards the lake, as if he longed to throw
it far into the water. He checked himself, and,
turning it about with a disdainful air, said,
coldly,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“If <em>I</em> had given you this, it should have been
quite perfect. The cross is not large nor fine
enough to match the chain. Do you see?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah, but the little cross is more precious
than all the rest! That is the one jewel my
mother left me, and I put it there to make my
rosary complete;” and Gladys surveyed it with a
pretty mixture of devout affection and girlish
pleasure.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll give you a better one than this,—a string
of tiny carved saints in scented wood, blessed
by holy hands, and fit to say prayers like yours
upon. You will take it, though my gift is not
half so costly as his?” he said, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>“Whose?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Helwyze gave you that.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But why?” and Gladys opened wide her
clear, large eyes in genuine astonishment.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He is a generous master; your singing
pleases him, and he pays you so,” replied Canaris,
bitterly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He is not my master!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He will be.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Never! I shall not go, if I am to be burdened
with benefits. I will earn my just due, but not
be overpaid. Tell him so.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Gladys caught back the chain, unclasped the
cross, and threw the pearls upon the grass, where
they lay, gleaming, like great drops of frozen dew,
among the green. Canaris liked that; thought
proudly, “<em>I</em> have no need to bribe;” and hastened
to make his own the thing another seemed
to covet. Drawing nearer, he looked up, asking,
in a tone that gave the question its true meaning,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“May <em>I</em> be your master, Gladys?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not even you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Your slave, then?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Never that.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Your lover?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>“But I can give you nothing except myself.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Love is enough;” and finding his arms
about her, his face, warm and wistful, close to
hers, Gladys bent to give and take the first kiss,
which was all they had to bestow upon each
other.</p>

<p class='c006'>Singularly unimpassioned was the embrace in
which they stood for a brief instant. Canaris
held her with a clasp more jealous than fond;
Gladys clung to him, yet trembled, as if some
fear subdued her joy; and both vaguely felt the
incompleteness of a moment which should be
perfect.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You do love me, then?” she whispered,
wondering at his silence.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Should I ask you to be my wife if I did not?”
and the stern look melted into an expression of
what seemed, to her, reproach.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No; ah, no! I fancied that I might have
deceived myself. I am so young, you are so kind.
I never had a—friend before;” and Gladys
smiled shyly, as the word which meant “lover”
dropped from her lips.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am not kind: I am selfish, cruel, perhaps,
to let you love me so. You will never reproach
me for it, Gladys? I mean to save you from ills
you know nothing of; to cherish and protect you—if
I can.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>Verily in earnest now; for the touch of those
innocent lips reminded him of all his promise
meant, recalled his own unfitness to guide or
guard another, when so wayward and unwise
himself. Gladys could not understand the true
cause of his beseeching look, his urgency of tone;
but saw in them only the generous desire to keep
safe the creature dearest to him, and loved him
the more for it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I never can think you selfish, never will reproach
you but will love and trust and honor
you all my life,” she answered, with a simplicity
as solemn as sincere; and, holding out the hand
that held her dead mother’s cross, Canaris
pledged his troth upon it with the mistaken
chivalry which makes many a man promise to
defend a woman against all men but himself.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now you can be happy again,” he said, feeling
that he had done his best to keep her so.</p>

<p class='c006'>She thought he meant look out upon the lake,
dreaming of him as when he found her; and, turning,
stretched forth her arms as if to embrace
the whole world, and tell the smiling heaven her
glad secret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Doubly happy; then I only hoped, now I
<em>know</em>!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Something in the exultant gesture, the fervent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>tone, the radiant face, thrilled Canaris with a
sudden admiration; a feeling of proud possession;
a conviction that he had gained, not lost; and
he said within himself,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am glad I did it. I will cherish her; she
will inspire me; and good <em>shall</em> come out of seeming
evil.”</p>

<p class='c006'>His spirits rose with a new sense of well-being
and well-doing. He gathered up the rejected
treasure, and gave it back to Gladys, saying
lightly,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“You may keep it as a wedding-gift; then he
need give no other. He meant it so, perhaps,
and it will please him. Will you, love?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“If you ask it. But why must brides wear
pearls? They mean tears,” she added, thoughtfully,
as she received them back.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Perhaps because then the sorrows of their
lives begin. Yours shall not: I will see to that,”
he promised, with the blind confidence of the
self-sacrificing mood he was in.</p>

<p class='c006'>Gladys sat down upon the rock to explore a
pocket, so small and empty that Canaris could
not help smiling, as he, too, leaned and looked
with a lover’s freedom.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Only my old chain. I must put back the
cross, else I shall lose it,” laughed Gladys, as she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>brought out a little cord of what seemed woven
yellow silk.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is it your hair?” he asked, his eye caught
by its peculiar sunshiny hue.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes; I could not buy a better one, so I made
this. My hair is all the gold I have.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Give it to me, and you wear mine. See, I
have an amulet as well as you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Fumbling in his breast, Canaris undid a
slender chain, whence hung a locket, curiously
chased, and tarnished with long wear. This he
unslung, and, opening, showed Gladys the faded
picture of a beautiful, sad woman.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is my Madonna.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Your mother?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mine now.” The girl touched it with her
lips, then softly closed and laid it on her lap.</p>

<p class='c006'>Silently Canaris stood watching her, as she
re-slung both poor but precious relics, while the
costlier one slipped down, as if ashamed to lie
beside them. He caught and swung it on his
finger, thinking of something he had lately read
to Helwyze.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Kharsu, the Persian, sent a necklace to
Schirin, the princess, whom he loved. She was
a Christian, and hung a cross upon his string
of pearls, as you did,” he said aloud.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>“But I am not a princess, and Mr. Helwyze
does not love me; so the pretty story is all
spoiled.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“This thing recalled it. <em>I</em> have given you a
necklace, and you are hanging a cross upon it.
Wear the one, and use the other, for my sake.
Will you, Gladys?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Did Schirin convert Kharsu?” asked the
girl, catching his thought more from his face
than his words; for it wore a look of mingled
longing and regret, which she had never seen
before.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That I do not know; but you must convert
me: I am a sad heathen, Helwyze says.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Has <em>he</em> tried?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then I will!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You see I’ve had no one to teach me any
thing but worldly wisdom, and I sometimes feel
as I should be better for a little of the heavenly
sort. So when you wear the rosary I shall give
you—‘Fair saint, in your orisons be all my sins
remembered;’” and Canaris put his hand upon
her head, smiling, as if half-ashamed of his
request.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am no Catholic, but I <em>will</em> pray for you,
and you shall not be lost. The mother in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>heaven and the wife on earth will keep you
safe,” whispered Gladys, in her fervent voice,
feeling and answering with a woman’s quickness
the half-expressed desire of a nature conscious
of its weakness, yet unskilled in asking help for
its greatest need.</p>

<p class='c006'>Silently the two young lovers put on their
amulets, and, hand in hand, went back along the
winding path, till they reached the great eglantine
that threw its green arches across the outlet
from the wood. All beyond was radiantly
bright and blooming; and as Canaris, passing
first to hold back the thorny boughs, stood an
instant, bathed in the splendor of the early sunshine,
Gladys exclaimed, her face full of the
tender idolatry of a loving woman,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“O Felix, you are so good, so great, so
beautiful, if it were not wicked, I should worship
you!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“God forbid! Do not love me too much,
Gladys: I do not deserve it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How can I help it, when I feel very like the
girl who lost her heart to the Apollo?” she
answered, feeling that she never could love <em>too
much</em>.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And broke her heart, you remember, because
her god was only a stone.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>“Mine is not, and he will answer when I call.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“If he does not, he will be harder and colder
than the marble!”</p>

<p class='c006'>When Canaris, some hours later, told Helwyze,
he looked well pleased, thinking, “Jealousy
is a helpful ally. I do not regret calling
in its aid, though it has cost Olivia her pearls.”
Aloud he said, with a gracious air, which did not
entirely conceal some secret anxiety,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then you have made a clean breast of it, and
she forgives all peccadilloes?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have not told her; and I will not, till I have
atoned for the meanest of them. May I ask you
to be silent also for her sake?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are wise.” Then, as if glad to throw
off all doubt and care, he asked, in a pleasantly
suggestive tone,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“The wedding will soon follow the wooing, I
imagine, for you make short work of matters,
when you do begin?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You told me to execute your wish in my
own way. I will do so, without troubling Mrs.
Surry, or asking you to give us your blessing,
since playing the father to orphans is distasteful
to you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Very calm and cool was Canaris now; but a
sense of wrong burned at his heart, marring the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>satisfaction he felt in having done what he believed
to be a just and generous act.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is; but I will assume the character long
enough to suggest, nay, <em>insist</em>, that however hasty
and informal this marriage may be, you will take
care that it <em>is</em> one.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you mean that for a hint or a warning,
sir? I have lied and stolen by your advice; shall
I also betray?” asked Canaris, white with indignation,
and something like fear; for he began to
feel that whatever this man commanded he must
do, spite of himself.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Strong language, Felix. But I forgive it,
since I am sincere in wishing well to Gladys.
Marry when and how you please, only do not
annoy me with another spasm of virtue. It is a
waste of time, you see, for the thing is done.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not yet; but soon will be, for you are fast
curing me of a too tender conscience.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Faster than you think, my Faust; since to
marry without love betrays as surely as to love
without marriage,” said Helwyze to himself, expressing
in words the thought that had restrained
the younger, better man.</p>

<p class='c006'>A week later, Canaris came in with Gladys
on his arm, looking very like a bride in a little
bonnet tied with white, and a great nosegay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>of all the sweet, pale flowers blooming in the
garden that first Sunday of September.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good-bye, sir; we are going.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where, may I ask? To church?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We have been;” and Canaris touched the
ungloved hand that lay upon his arm, showing
the first ring it had ever worn.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah! then I can only say, Heaven bless
you, Gladys; a happy honeymoon, Felix, and
welcome home when—you are tired of each
other.”</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c000' />
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>VIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>“Home at last, thank Heaven!” exclaimed
Canaris, as the door opened, letting
forth a stream of light and warmth into the
chilly gloom of the October night. Gladys made
no answer but an upward look, which seemed to
utter the tender welcome he had forgotten to
give; and, nestling her hand in his, let him lead
her through the bright hall, up the wide stairway
to her own domain.</p>

<p class='c006'>“As we return a little before our time, we
must not expect a jubilee. Look about you,
love, and rest. I will send Mrs. Bland presently,
and tell Helwyze we are come.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He hurried away, showing no sign of the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>ennui</i></span> which had fitfully betrayed itself during the
last week. Gladys watched him wistfully, then
turned to see what home was like, with eyes
that brightened beautifully as they took in the
varied charms of the luxurious apartments prepared
for her. The newly kindled light filled
the room with a dusky splendor; for deepest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>crimson glowed everywhere, making her feel as
if she stood in the heart of a great rose whose
silken petals curtained her round with a color,
warmth, and fragrance which would render sleep
a “rapture of repose.” Womanlike, she enjoyed
every dainty device and sumptuous detail; yet
the smile of pleasure was followed by a faint
sigh, as if the new magnificence oppressed her,
or something much desired had been forgotten.</p>

<p class='c006'>Stepping carefully, like one who had no right
there, she passed on to a charming drawing-room,
evidently intended for but two occupants,
and all the pleasanter to her for that suggestion.
Pausing on the threshold of another door, she
peeped in, expecting to find one of those scented,
satin boudoirs, which are fitter for the coquetries
of a Parisian belle, than for a young wife to
hope and dream and pray in.</p>

<p class='c006'>But there was no splendor here; and, with a
cry of glad surprise, its new owner took possession,
wondering what gentle magic had guessed
and gathered here the simple treasures she
best loved. White everywhere, except the pale
green of the softly tinted walls, and the mossy
carpet strewn with mimic snowdrops. A sheaf
of lilies in a silver vase stood on the low chimney-piece
above the hearth, where a hospitable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>fire lay ready to kindle at a touch; and this
was the only sign of luxury the room displayed.
Quaint furniture, with no ornament except its
own grace or usefulness, gave the place a homelike
air; and chintz hangings, fresh and delicate as
green leaves scattered upon snow could make
them, seemed to shut out the world, securing
the sweet privacy a happy woman loves.</p>

<p class='c006'>Gladys felt this instantly, and, lifting her hand
to draw the pretty draperies yet closer, discovered
a new surprise, which touched her to the
heart. Instead of looking out into the darkness
of the autumn night, she found a little woodland
nook imprisoned between the glass-door and the
deep window beyond. A veritable bit of the
forest, with slender ferns nodding in their sleep,
hardy vines climbing up a lichened stump to
show their scarlet berries, pine-needles pricking
through the moss, rough arbutus leaves hiding
coyly till spring should freshen their russet
edges, acorns looking as if just dropped by
some busy squirrel, and all manner of humble
weeds, growing here as happily as when they
carpeted the wood for any careless foot to tread
upon.</p>

<p class='c006'>These dear familiar things were as grateful
to Gladys as the sight of friendly faces; and,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>throwing wide the doors, she knelt down to
breathe with childish eagerness the damp, fresh
odors that came out to meet her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How sweet of him to make such a lovely nest
for me, and then slip away before I could thank
him,” thought the tender-hearted creature, with
tears in the eyes that dwelt delightedly upon the
tremulous maiden-hair bending to her touch,
and the sturdy grasses waking up in this new
summer.</p>

<p class='c006'>A sound of opening doors dispelled her reverie;
and with girlish trepidation she hastened
to smooth the waves of her bright hair, assume
the one pretty dress she would accept from
Olivia, and clasp the bridal pearls about her
neck; then hastened down before the somewhat
dreaded Mrs. Bland appeared.</p>

<p class='c006'>It pleased her to go wandering alone through
the great house, warmed and lighted everywhere;
for Helwyze made this his world, and
gathered about him every luxury which taste,
caprice, or necessity demanded. A marvellously
beautiful and varied home it seemed to simple
Gladys, as she passed from picture-gallery to
music-room, eyed with artless wonder the subdued
magnificence of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>salon</i></span>, or paused enchanted
in a conservatory whose crystal walls
enclosed a fairyland of bloom and verdure.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>Here and there she came upon some characteristic
whim or arrangement, which made her
smile with amusement, or sigh with pity, remembering
the recluse who tried to cheer his
solitude by these devices. One recess held a
single picture glowing with the warm splendor
of the East. A divan, a Persian rug, an amber-mouthed
<i>nargileh</i>, and a Turkish coffee service,
all gold and scarlet, completed the illusion. In
another shadowy nook tinkled a little fountain
guarded by one white-limbed nymph, who seemed
to watch with placid interest the curious sea-creatures
peopling the basin below. The third
showed a study-chair, a shaded lamp, and certain
favorite books, left open, as if to be taken
up again when the mood returned. In one
of these places Gladys lingered with fresh compassion
stirring at her heart, though it looked
the least inviting of them all. Behind the curtains
of a window looking out upon the broad
street on which the mansion faced stood a
single chair, and nothing more.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He shall not be so lonely now, if I can interest
or amuse him,” thought Gladys, as she looked
at the worn spot in the carpet, the crumpled
cushion on the window-ledge; mute witnesses
that Helwyze felt drawn towards his kin, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>found some solace in watching the activity he
could no longer share.</p>

<p class='c006'>Knowing that she should find him in the
library, where most of his time was spent, she
soon wended her way thither. The door stood
hospitably open; and, as she approached, she
saw the two men standing together, marked, as
never before, the sharp contrast between them,
and felt a glow of wifely pride in the young husband
whom she was learning to love with all the
ardor of a pure and tender soul.</p>

<p class='c006'>Canaris was talking eagerly, as he turned the
leaves of a thin manuscript which lay between
them. Helwyze listened, with his eyes fixed on
the speaker so intently that it startled the new-comer,
when, without a sound to warn him of her
approach, he turned suddenly upon her with the
smile which dazzled without warming those on
whom it was shed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have been chiding this capricious fellow for
the haste which spoils the welcome I hoped to
give you. But I pardon him, since he brings the
sunshine with him,” he said, going to meet her,
with genuine pleasure in his face.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I could not have a kinder welcome, sir. I
was glad to come; Felix feared you might be
needing him.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>“So duty brought him back a week too soon?
A poet’s honeymoon should be a long one; I
regret to be the cause of its abridgment.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Something in the satirical glimmer of his eye
made Gladys glance at her husband, who spoke
out frankly,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“There were other reasons. Gladys hates a
crowd, and so do I. Bad weather made it impossible
to be romantic, so we thought it best to
come home and be comfortable.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I trust you will be; but I have little to offer,
since the attractions of half a dozen cities could
not satisfy you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Indeed, we should be most ungrateful if we
were not happy here,” cried Gladys, eagerly.
“Only let me be useful as well as happy, else I
shall not deserve this lovely home you give us.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She is anxious to begin her ministrations;
and I can recommend her, for she is quick to
learn one’s ways, patient with one’s whims, fruitful
in charming devices for amusement, and
the best of comrades,” said Canaris, drawing her
to him with a look more grateful than fond.</p>

<p class='c006'>“From that speech, and other signs, I infer
that Felix is about to leave me to your tender
mercies, and fall to work upon his new book;
since it seems he could not resist making poetry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>when he should have been making love. Are
you not jealous of the rival who steals him from
you, even before the honeymoon has set?” asked
Helwyze, touching the little manuscript before
him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not if she makes him great, and I can make
him happy,” answered Gladys, with an air of
perfect content and trust.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I warn you that the Muse is a jealous mistress,
and will often rob you of him. Are you ready to
give him up, and resign yourself to more prosaic
companionship?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why need I give him up? He says I do not
disturb him when he writes. He allowed me to
sit beside him while he made these lovely songs,
and watch them grow. He even let me help
with a word sometimes, and I copied the verses
fairly, that he might see how beautiful they were.
Did I not, Felix?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Gladys spoke with such innocent pride, and
looked up in her husband’s face so gratefully,
that he could not but thank her with a caress, as
he said, laughing,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah, that was only play. I’ve had my holiday,
and now I must work at a task in which no one
can help me. Come and see the den where I
shut myself up when the divine frenzy seizes me.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Mr. Helwyze is jailer, and only lets me out when
I have done my stint.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Full of some pleasurable excitement, Canaris
led his wife across the room, threw open a door,
and bade her look in. Like a curious child, she
peeped, but saw only a small, bare <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>cabinet de
travail</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No room, you see, even for a little thing like
you. None dare enter here without my keeper’s
leave. Remember that, else you may fare like
Bluebeard’s Fatima.” Canaris spoke gayly, and
turned a key in the door with a warning click, as
he glanced over his shoulder at Helwyze. Gladys
did not see the look, but something in his words
seemed to disturb her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do not like this place, it is close and dark.
I think I shall not want to come, even if you <em>are</em>
here;” and, waiting for no reply, she stepped
out from the chill of the unused room, as if glad
to escape.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mysterious intuition! she felt that we had a
skeleton in here, though it is such a little one,”
whispered Canaris, with an uneasy laugh.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Such a sensitive plant will fare ill between
us, I am afraid,” answered Helwyze, as he followed
her, leaving the other to open drawers
and settle papers, like one eager to begin his
work.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>Gladys was standing in the full glare of the
fire, as if its cheerful magic could exorcise all
dark fancies. Helwyze eyed the white figure for
an instant, feeling that his lonely hearthstone had
acquired a new charm; then joined her, saying
quietly,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“This is the place where Felix and I have
lived together for nearly two years. Do you like
it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“More than I can tell. It does not seem
strange to me, for he has often described it; and
when I thought of coming here, I was more
curious to see this room than any other.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It will be all the pleasanter henceforth if
Felix can spare you to me sometimes. Come
and see the corner I have prepared, hoping to
tempt you here when he shuts us out. It used
to be his; so you will like it, I think.” Helwyze
paced slowly down the long room, Gladys beside
him, saying, as she looked about her hungrily,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“So many books! and doubtless you have read
them all?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not quite; but you may, if you will. See,
here is your place; come often, and be sure you
never will disturb me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But one book lay on the little table, and its
white cover, silver lettered, shone against the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>dark cloth so invitingly that Gladys took it up,
glowing with pleasure as she read her own name
upon the volume she knew and loved so well.</p>

<p class='c006'>“For me? you knew that nothing else would
be so beautiful and precious. Sir, why are you
so generous?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It amuses me to do these little things, and
you must humor me, as Felix does. You shall
pay for them in your own coin, so there need be
no sense of obligation. Rest satisfied I shall
get the best of the bargain.” Before she could
reply a servant appeared, announced dinner, and
vanished as noiselessly as he came.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This has been a bachelor establishment so
long that we are grown careless. If you will
pardon all deficiencies of costume, we will not
delay installing Madame Canaris in the place
she does us the honor to fill.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But I am not the mistress, sir. Please
change nothing; my place at home was very
humble; I am afraid I cannot fill the new one as
I ought,” stammered Gladys, somewhat dismayed
at the prospect which the new name and duty
suggested.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You will have no care, except of us. Mrs.
Bland keeps the machinery running smoothly,
and we lead a very quiet life. My territory ends
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>at that door; all beyond is yours. I chiefly
haunt this wing, but sometimes roam about
below stairs a little, a very harmless ghost, so
do not be alarmed if you should meet me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Helwyze spoke lightly, and tapped at the door
of the den as he passed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come out, slave of the pen, and be fed.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Canaris came, wearing a preoccupied air, and
sauntered after them, as Helwyze led the new
mistress to her place, shy and rosy, but resolved
to do honor to her husband at all costs.</p>

<p class='c006'>Her first act, however, gave them both a
slight shock of surprise; for the instant they
were seated, Gladys laid her hands together,
bent her head, and whispered Grace, as if obeying
a natural impulse to ask Heaven’s blessing
on the first bread she broke in her new home.
The effect of the devoutly simple act was characteristically
shown by the three observers. The
servant paused, with an uplifted cover in his
hand, respectfully astonished; Canaris looked
intensely annoyed; and Helwyze leaned back
with the suggestion of a shrug, as he glanced
critically from the dimpled hands to the nugget
of gold that shone against the bended neck. The
instant she looked up, the man whisked off the
silver cover with an air of relief; Canaris fell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>upon his bread like a hungry boy, and Helwyze
tranquilly began to talk.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Was the surprise Felix prepared for you a
satisfactory one? Olivia and I took pleasure in
obeying his directions.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It was lovely! I have not thanked him yet,
but I shall. You, also, sir, in some better way
than words. What made you think of it?” she
asked, looking at Canaris with a mute request
for pardon of her involuntary offence.</p>

<p class='c006'>Glad to rush into speech, Canaris gave at
some length the history of his fancy to reproduce,
as nearly as he could, the little room at
home, which she had described to him with regretful
minuteness; for she had sold every thing
to pay the debts which were the sole legacy her
father left her. While they talked, Helwyze,
who ate little, was observing both. Gladys
looked more girlish than ever, in spite of the
mingled dignity and anxiety her quiet but timid
air betrayed. Canaris seemed in high spirits,
talking rapidly, laughing often, and glancing
about him as if glad to be again where nothing
inharmonious disturbed his taste and comfort.
Not till dessert was on the table, however, did
he own, in words, the feeling of voluptuous
satisfaction which was enhanced by the memory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>that he had been rash enough to risk the loss
of all.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is not so very terrible, you see, Gladys.
You eat and drink like a bird; but I know you
enjoy this as much as I do, after those detestable
hotels,” he said, detecting an expression of
relief in his young wife’s face, as the noiseless
servant quitted the room for the last time.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Indeed I do. It is so pleasant to have all
one’s senses gratified at once, and the common
duties of life made beautiful and easy,” answered
Gladys, surveying with feminine appreciation
the well-appointed table which had that air of
accustomed elegance so grateful to fastidious
tastes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah, ha! this little ascetic of mine will become
a Sybarite yet, and agree with me that
enjoyment <em>is</em> a duty,” exclaimed Canaris, looking
very like a young Bacchus, as he held up his
wine to watch its rich color, and inhale its bouquet
with zest.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The more delicate the senses, the more delicate
the delight. I suspect Madame finds her
grapes and water as delicious as you do your
olives and old wine,” said Helwyze, finding a
still more refined satisfaction than either in the
pretty contrast between the purple grapes and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>the white fingers that pulled them apart, the
softly curling lips that were the rosier for their
temperate draughts, and the unspoiled simplicity
of the girl sitting there in pearls and shimmering
silk.</p>

<p class='c006'>“When one has known poverty, and the sad
shifts which make it seem mean, as well as hard,
perhaps one does unduly value these things. I
hope I shall not; but I do find them very tempting,”
she said, thoughtfully eying the new scene
in which she found herself.</p>

<p class='c006'>Helwyze seemed to be absently listening to
the musical chime of silver against glass; but he
made a note of that hope, wondering if hardship
had given her more of its austere virtue than it
had her husband.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How shall you resist temptation?” he asked,
curiously.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I shall work. This is dangerously pleasant;
so let me begin at once, and sing, while you take
your coffee in the drawing-room. I know the
way; come when you will, I shall be ready;”
and Gladys rose with the energetic expression
which often broke through her native gentleness.
Canaris held the door for her, and was
about to resume his seat, when Helwyze checked
him:—</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>“We will follow at once. Was I not right in
my prediction?” he asked, as they left the room
together.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That we should soon tire of each other?
You were wrong in that.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I meant the ease with which you would soon
learn to love.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have not learned—yet.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then this vivacity is a cloak for the pangs
of remorse, is it?” and Helwyze laughed incredulously.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No: it is the satisfaction I already feel in
the atonement I mean to make. I have a grand
idea. <em>I</em>, too, shall work, and give Gladys reason
to be proud of me, if nothing more.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Something of her own energy was in his mien,
and it became him. But Helwyze quenched the
noble ardor by saying, coldly,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“I see: it is the old passion under a new
name. May your virtuous aspirations be blest!”</p>
<div class='pbb'>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>IX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>Helwyze was right, and Canaris found
that his sudden marriage did stimulate
public interest wonderfully. There had always
been something mysterious about this brilliant
young man and his relations with his patron;
who was as silent as the Sphinx regarding his
past, and tantalizingly enigmatical about his
plans and purposes for the future. The wildest
speculations were indulged in: many believed
them to be father and son; others searched
vainly for the true motive of this charitable
caprice; and every one waited with curiosity to
see the end of it. All of which much amused
Helwyze, who cared nothing for the world’s opinion,
and found his sense of humor tickled by the
ludicrous idea of himself in the new <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>rôle</i></span> of
benefactor.</p>

<p class='c006'>The romance seemed quite complete when it
was known that the young poet had brought
home a wife whose talent, youth, and isolation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>seemed to render her peculiarly fitted for his
mate.</p>

<p class='c006'>Though love was lacking, vanity was strong in
Canaris, and this was gratified by the commendation
bestowed on the new ornament he wore;
for as such simple Gladys was considered, and
shone with reflected lustre, her finer gifts and
graces quite eclipsed by his more conspicuous
and self-asserting ones.</p>

<p class='c006'>With unquestioning docility she gave herself
into his hands, following where he led her, obeying
his lightest wish, and loving him with a
devotion which kept alive regretful tenderness
when it should have cherished a loyal love. He
gladly took her into all the gayety which for a
time surrounded them, and she enjoyed it with a
girl’s fresh delight. He showed her wise and
witty people whom she admired or loved; and she
looked and listened with an enthusiast’s wonder.
He gave her all he had to give, novelty and
pleasure; though the one had lost its gloss for
him, and too much of the other he was forced to
accept from Helwyze’s hands. But through all
the experiences that now rapidly befell her,
Gladys was still herself; innocently happy,
stanchly true, characteristically independent,
a mountain stream, keeping its waters pure and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>bright, though mingled with the swift and turbid
river which was hurrying it toward the sea.</p>

<p class='c006'>Curiosity being satisfied, society soon found
some fresher novelty to absorb it. Women still
admired Canaris, but marriage lessened his attractions
for them; men still thought him full
of promise, but were fast forgetting the first
successful effort which had won their applause;
and the young lion found that he must roar loud
and often, if he would not be neglected. Shutting
himself into his cell, he worked with hopeful
energy for several months, often coming out
weary, but excited, with the joyful labor of creation.
At such times there was no prose anywhere;
for heaven and earth were glorified by
the light of that inner world, where imagination
reigns, and all things are divine. Then he would
be in the gayest spirits, and carry Gladys off
to some hour of pleasant relaxation at theatre,
opera, or ball, where flattery refreshed or emulation
inspired him; and next day would return to
his task with redoubled vigor.</p>

<p class='c006'>At other times his fickle mistress deserted
him; thought would not soar, language would
not sing, poetry fled, and life was unutterably
“flat, stale, and unprofitable.” Then it was
Gladys, who took possession of him; lured him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>out for a brisk walk, or a long drive into a
wholesomer world than that into which he took
her; sung weary brain to sleep with the sweetest
lullabies of brother bards; or made him
merry by the display of a pretty wit, which
none but he knew she could exert. With wifely
patience and womanly tact she managed her
wayward but beloved lord, till despondency
yielded to her skill, and the buoyant spirit of
hope took him by the hand, and led him to his
work again.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the intervals between these fits of intellectual
intoxication and succeeding depression,
Gladys devoted herself to Helwyze with a faithfulness
which surprised him and satisfied her;
for, as she said, her “bread tasted bitter if she
did not earn it.” He had expected to be amused,
perhaps interested, but not so charmed, by this
girl, who possessed only a single talent, a modest
share of beauty, and a mind as untrained as a
beautiful but neglected garden. This last was
the real attraction; for, finding her hungry for
knowledge, he did not hesitate to test her taste
and try her mental mettle, by allowing her free
range of a large and varied library. Though
not a scholar, in the learned sense of the word,
he had the eager, sceptical nature which interrogates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>all things, yet believes only in itself.
This had kept him roaming solitarily up and
down the earth for years, observing men and
manners; now it drove him to books; and, as
suffering and seclusion wrought upon body and
brain, his choice of mute companions changed
from the higher, healthier class to those who, like
himself, leaned towards the darker, sadder side
of human nature. Lawless here, as elsewhere,
he let his mind wander at will, as once he had
let his heart, learning too late that both are
sacred gifts, and cannot safely be tampered
with.</p>

<p class='c006'>All was so fresh and wonderful to Gladys,
that her society grew very attractive to him;
and pleasant as it was to have her wait upon
him with quiet zeal, or watch her busied in her
own corner, studying, or sewing with the little
basket beside her which gave such a homelike
air, it was still pleasanter to have her sit and
read to him, while he watched this face, so intelligent,
yet so soft; studied this mind, at once
sensitive and sagacious, this nature, both serious
and ardent. It gave a curious charm to his old
favorites when she read them; and many hours
he listened contentedly to the voice whose youth
made Montaigne’s worldly wisdom seem the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>shrewder; whose music gave a certain sweetness
to Voltaire’s bitter wit or Carlyle’s rough wisdom;
whose pitying wonder added pathos to the melancholy
brilliancy of Heine and De Quincy. Equally
fascinating to him, and far more dangerous to
her, were George Sand’s passionate romances,
Goethe’s dramatic novels, Hugo and Sue’s lurid
word-pictures of suffering and sin; the haunted
world of Shakespeare and Dante, the poetry of
Byron, Browning, and Poe.</p>

<p class='c006'>Rich food and strong wine for a girl of eighteen;
and Gladys soon felt the effects of such
a diet, though it was hard to resist when duty
seconded inclination, and ignorance hid the
peril. She often paused to question with eager
lips, to wipe wet eyes, to protest with indignant
warmth, or to shiver with the pleasurable pain
of a child who longs, yet dreads, to hear an exciting
story to the end. Helwyze answered
willingly, if not always wisely; enjoyed the rapid
unfolding of the woman, and would not deny
himself any indulgence of this new whim,
though conscious that the snow-drop, transplanted
suddenly from the free fresh spring-time,
could not live in this close air without suffering.</p>

<p class='c006'>This was the double life Gladys now began to
lead. Heart and mind were divided between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>the two, who soon absorbed every feeling,
every thought. To the younger man she was
a teacher, to the elder a pupil; in the one world
she ruled, in the other served; unconsciously
Canaris stirred emotion to its depths, consciously
Helwyze stimulated intellect to its
heights; while the soul of the woman, receiving
no food from either, seemed to sit apart in
the wilderness of its new experience, tempted
by evil as well as sustained by good spirits, who
guard their own.</p>

<p class='c006'>One evening this divided mastery was especially
felt by Helwyze, who watched the
young man’s influence over his wife with a
mixture of interest and something like jealousy, as
it was evidently fast becoming stronger than his
own. Sitting in his usual place, he saw Gladys
flit about the room, brushing up the hearth,
brightening the lamps, and putting by the finished
books, as if the day’s duties were all done,
the evening’s rest and pleasure honestly earned,
eagerly waited for. He well knew that this
pleasure consisted in carrying Canaris away to
her own domain; or, if that were impossible, she
would sit silently looking at him while he read
or talked in his fitful fashion on any subject his
master chose to introduce.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>The desire to make her forget the husband
whose neglect would have sorely grieved her if
his genius had not been his excuse in her eyes
for many faults, possessed Helwyze that night;
and he amused himself by the effort, becoming
more intent with each failure.</p>

<p class='c006'>As the accustomed hour drew near, Gladys
took her place on the footstool before the chair
set ready for Felix, and fell a musing, with her
eyes on the newly replenished fire. Above, the
unignited fuel lay black and rough, with here
and there a deep rift opening to the red core
beneath; while to and fro danced many colored
flames, as if bent on some eager quest. Many
flashed up the chimney, and were gone; others
died solitarily in dark corners, where no heat fed
them; and some vanished down the chasms, to the
fiery world below. One golden spire, tremulous
and translucent, burned with a brilliance which
attracted the eye; and, when a wandering violet
flame joined it, Gladys followed their motions
with interest, seeing in them images of Felix
and herself, for childish fancy and womanly insight
met and mingled in all she thought and
felt.</p>

<p class='c006'>Forgetting that she was not alone, she leaned
forward, to watch what became of them, as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>wedded flames flickered here and there, now
violet, now yellow. But the brighter always
seemed the stronger, and the sad-colored one to
grow more and more golden, as if yielding to its
sunshiny mate.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I hope they will fly up together, out into the
wide, starry sky, which is their eternity, perhaps,”
she thought, smiling at her own eagerness.</p>

<p class='c006'>But no; the golden flame flew up, and left the
other to take on many shapes and colors, as it
wandered here and there, till, just as it glowed
with a splendid crimson, Gladys was forced to
hide her dazzled eyes and look no more. Turning
her flushed face away, she found Helwyze
watching her as intently as she had watched the
fire, and, reminded of his presence, she glanced
toward the empty chair with an impatient sigh
for Felix.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are tired,” he said, answering the sigh.
“Mrs. Bland told me what a notable housewife
you are, and how you helped her set the upper
regions to rights to-day. I fear you did too much.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, no, I enjoyed it heartily. I asked for
something to do, and she allowed me to examine
and refold the treasures you keep in the great
carved wardrobe, lest moths or damp or dust had
hurt the rich stuffs, curious coins, and lovely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>ornaments stored there. I never saw so many
pretty things before,” she answered, betraying,
by her sudden animation, the love of “pretty
things,” which is one of the strongest of feminine
foibles.</p>

<p class='c006'>He smiled, well pleased.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Olivia calls that quaint press from Brittany
my bazaar, for there I have collected the spoils
of my early wanderings; and when I want a
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>cadeau</i></span> for a fair friend, I find it without trouble.
I saw in what exquisite order you left my shelves,
and, as you were not with me to choose, I
brought away several trifles, more curious than
costly, hoping to find a thank-offering among
them.”</p>

<p class='c006'>As he spoke, he opened one of the deep drawers
in the writing-table, as if to produce some
gift. But Gladys said, hastily,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are very kind, sir; but these fine things
are altogether too grand for me. The pleasure
of looking at and touching them is reward enough;
unless you will tell me about them: it must be
interesting to know what places they came from.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Feeling in the mood for it, Helwyze described to
her an Eastern bazaar, so graphically that she soon
forgot Felix, and sat looking up as if she actually
saw and enjoyed the splendors he spoke of.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>Lustrous silks sultanas were to wear; misty
muslins, into whose embroidery some dark-skinned
woman’s life was wrought; cashmeres,
many-hued as rainbows; odorous woods and
spices, that filled the air with fragrance never
blown from Western hills; amber, like drops of
frozen sunshine; fruits, which brought visions of
vineyards, olive groves, and lovely palms dropping
their honeyed clusters by desert wells; skins
mooned and barred with black upon the tawny
velvet, that had lain in jungles, or glided with
deathful stealthiness along the track of human
feet; ivory tusks that had felled Asiatic trees,
gored fierce enemies, or meekly lifted princes to
their seats.</p>

<p class='c006'>These, and many more, he painted rapidly; and,
as he ended, shook out of its folds a gauzy fabric,
starred with silver, which he threw over her
head, pointing to the mirror set in the door of
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>armoire</i></span> behind her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“See if that is not too pretty to refuse. Felix
would surely be inspired if you appeared before
him shimmering like Suleika, when Hatem says
to her,—</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c000'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Here, take this, with the pure and silver streaking,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And wind it, Darling, round and round for me;</div>
      <div class='line'>What is your Highness? Style scarce worth the speaking,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>When thou dost look, I am as great as He.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>Gladys did look, and saw how beautiful it made
her; but, though she did not understand the
words he quoted, the names suggested a sultan
and his slave, and she did not like either the idea
or the expression with which Helwyze regarded
her. Throwing off the gauzy veil, she refolded
and put it by, saying, in that decided little way
of hers, which was prettier than petulance,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“My Hatem does not need that sort of inspiration,
and had rather see his Suleika in a
plain gown of his choosing, than dressed in all
the splendors of the East by any other hand.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come, then, we must find some better <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>souvenir</i></span>
of your visit, for I never let any one go away
empty-handed;” with that he dipped again into
the drawer, and held up a pretty bracelet, explaining,
as he offered it with unruffled composure,
though she eyed it askance, attracted, yet
reluctant, a charming picture of doubt and desire,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Here are the Nine Muses, cut in many-tinted
lava. See how well the workman suited the color
to the attribute of each Muse. Urania is blue;
Erato, this soft pink; Terpsichore, violet; Euterpe
and Thalia, black and white; and the others,
these fine shades of yellow, dun, and drab. That
pleases you, I know; so let me put it on.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>It did please her; and she stretched out her
hand to accept it, gratified, yet conscious all the
while of the antagonistic spirit which often seized
her when with Helwyze. He put on the bracelet
with a satisfied air; but the clasp was imperfect,
and, at the first turn of the round wrist,
the Nine Muses fell to the ground.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is too heavy. I am not made to wear handcuffs
of any sort, you see: they will not stay on,
so it is of no use to try;” and Gladys picked up
the trinket with an odd sense of relief; though
poor Erato was cracked, and Thalia, like Fielding’s
fair Amelia, had a broken nose. She rose
to lay it on the table, and, as she turned away,
her eye went to the clock, as if reproaching herself
for that brief forgetfulness of her husband.
Half amused, half annoyed, and bent on having
his own way, even in so small a thing as this,
Helwyze drew up a chair, and, setting a Japanese
tray upon the table, said, invitingly,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come and see if these are more to your taste,
since fine raiment and foolish ornaments fail to
tempt you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, how curious and beautiful!” cried Gladys,
looking down upon a collection of Hindoo gods
and goddesses, in ebony or ivory: some hideous,
some lovely, all carved with wonderful delicacy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>and each with its appropriate symbol,—Vishnu,
and his serpent; Brahma, in the sacred lotus; Siva,
with seven faces; Kreeshna, the destroyer, with
many mouths; Varoon, god of the ocean; and
Kama, the Indian Cupid, bearing his bow of
sugar-cane strung with bees, to typify love’s sting
as well as sweetness. This last Gladys examined
longest, and kept in her hand as if it charmed
her; for the minute face of the youth was beautiful,
the slender figure full of grace, and the ivory
spotless.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You choose him for your idol? and well you
may, for he looks like Felix. Mine, if I have one,
is Siva, goddess of Fate, ugly, but powerful.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I will have no idol,—not even Felix, though
I sometimes fear I may make one of him before I
know it;” and Gladys put back the little figure
with a guilty look, as she confessed the great
temptation that beset her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are wise: idols are apt to have feet of
clay, and tumble down in spite of our blind adoration.
Better be a Buddhist, and have no god but
our own awakened thought; ‘the highest wisdom,’
as it is called,” said Helwyze, who had
lately been busy with the Sâkya Muni, and regarded
all religions with calm impartiality.</p>

<p class='c006'>“These are false gods, and we are done with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>them, since we know the true one,” began Gladys,
understanding him; for she had read aloud the
life of Gautama Buddha, and enjoyed it as a
legend; while he found its mystic symbolism
attractive, and nothing repellent in its idolatry.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But do we? How can you prove it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It needs no proving; the knowledge of it
was born in me, grows with my growth, and is
the life of my life,” cried Gladys, out of the fulness
of that natural religion which requires no
revelation except such as experience brings to
strengthen and purify it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“All are not so easily satisfied as you,” he
said, in the sceptical tone which always tried both
her patience and her courage; for, woman-like,
she could feel the truth of things, but could not
reason about them. He saw her face kindle,
and added, rapidly, having a mind to try how
firmly planted the faith of the pretty Puritan was:
“Most of us agree that Allah exists in some
form or other, but we fall out about who is the
true Prophet. You choose Jesus of Nazareth
for yours; I rather incline to this Indian Saint.
They are not unlike: this Prince left all to devote
his life to the redemption of mankind, suffered
persecutions and temptations, had his
disciples, and sent out the first apostles of whom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>we hear; was a teacher, with his parables, miracles,
and belief in transmigration or immortality.
His doctrine is almost the same as the other;
and the six virtues which secure Nirvâna, or
Heaven, are charity, purity, patience, courage,
contemplation, and wisdom. Come, why not
take him for a model?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Gladys listened with a mixture of perplexity
and pain in her face, and her hand went involuntarily
to the little cross which she always
wore; but, though her eye was troubled, her
voice was steady, as she answered, earnestly,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Because I have a nobler one. My Prince
left a greater throne than yours to serve mankind;
suffered and resisted more terrible persecution
and temptation; sent out wiser apostles,
taught clearer truth, and preached an immortality
for all. Yours died peacefully in the arms
of his friends, mine on a cross; and, though
he came later, he has saved more souls than
Buddha. Sir, I know little about those older
religions; I am not wise enough even to argue
about my own: I can only believe in it, love it,
and hold fast to it, since it is all I need.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How can you tell till you try others? This,
now, is a fine one, if we are not too bigoted to
look into it fairly. Wise men, who have done
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>so, say that no faith—not even the Christian—has
exercised so powerful an influence on the
diminution of crime as the old, simple doctrine
of Sâkya Muni; and this is the only great historic
religion that has not taken the sword to
put down its enemies. Can you say as much
for yours?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No; but it is worth fighting for, and I <em>would</em>
fight, as the Maid of Orleans did for France,
for this is my country. Can you say of <em>your</em>
faith that it sustained you in sorrow, made
you happy in loneliness, saved you from temptation,
taught, guided, blessed you day by day
with unfailing patience, wisdom, and love? I
think you cannot; then why try to take mine
away till you can give me a better?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Seldom was Gladys so moved as now, for she
felt as if he was about to meddle with her holy
of holies; and, without stopping to reason, she
resisted the attempt, sure that he would harm,
not help, her, since neither his words nor example
had done Felix any good.</p>

<p class='c006'>Helwyze admired her all the more for her
resistance, and thought her unusually lovely, as
she stood there flushed and fervent with her
plea for the faith that was so dear to her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, indeed! You would make an excellent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>martyr, and enjoy it. Pity that you have
no chance of it, and so of being canonized as a
saint afterward. That is decidedly your line.
Then, you won’t have any of my gods? not even
this one?” he asked, holding up the handsome
Kama, with a smile.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, not even that. I will have only one
God, and you may keep your idols for those who
believe in them. My faith may not be the oldest,
but it <em>is</em> the best, if one may judge of the
two religions by the happiness and peace they
give,” answered Gladys, taking refuge in a very
womanly, yet most convincing, argument, she
thought, as she pointed to the mirror, which reflected
both figures in its clear depths.</p>

<p class='c006'>Helwyze looked, and though without an atom
of vanity, the sight could not but be trying, the
contrast was so great between her glad, young
face, and his, so melancholy and prematurely
old.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Satma, Tama—Truth and Darkness,” he
muttered to himself; adding aloud, with a
vengeful sort of satisfaction in shocking her
pious nature,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“But <em>I</em> have no religion; so that defiant little
speech is quite thrown away, my friend.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It did shock her; for, though she had suspected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>the fact, there was something dreadful
in hearing him confess it, in a tone which proved
his sincerity.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mr. Helwyze, do you really mean that you
believe in nothing invisible and divine? no life
beyond this? no God, no Christ to bless and
save?” she asked, hardly knowing how to put
the question, as she drew back dismayed, but
still incredulous.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He was both surprised, and rather annoyed, to
find that it cost him an effort to give even that
short answer, with those innocent eyes looking
so anxiously up at him, full of a sad wonder,
then dim with sudden dew, as she said eagerly,
forgetting every thing but a great compassion,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“O sir, it is impossible! You think so now;
but when you love and trust some human creature
more than yourself, then you will find that
you do believe in Him who gives such happiness,
and be glad to own it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Perhaps. Meantime <em>you</em> will not make me
happy by letting me give you any thing; why is
it, Gladys?”</p>

<p class='c006'>The black brows were knit, and he looked
impatient with himself or her. She saw it, and
exclaimed with the sweetest penitence,—</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>“Give me your pardon for speaking so frankly.
I mean no disrespect; but I cannot help it when
you say such things, though I know that gratitude
should keep me silent.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I like it. Do not take yourself to task for
that, or trouble about me. There are many
roads, and sooner or later we shall all reach
heaven, I suppose,—if there is one,” he added,
with a shrug, which spoiled the smile that went
before.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>X.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>Gladys stood silent for a moment, with
her eyes fixed on the little figures, longing
for wisdom to convince this man, whom she
regarded with mingled pity, admiration and distrust,
that he could not walk by his own light
alone. He guessed the impulse that kept her
there, longed to have her stay, and felt a sudden
desire to reinstate himself in her good opinion.
That wish, or the hope to keep her by some
new and still more powerful allurement, seemed
to actuate him as he hastily thrust the gods
and goddesses out of sight, and opened another
drawer, with a quick glance over his shoulder
towards that inner room.</p>

<p class='c006'>At that instant the clock struck, and Gladys
started, saying, in a tone of fond despair,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where <em>is</em> Felix? Will he never come?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I heard him raging about some time ago, but
perfect silence followed, so I suspect he caught
the tormenting word, idea, or fancy, and is busy
pinning it,” answered Helwyze, shutting the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>drawer as suddenly as he opened it, with a
frown which Gladys did not see; for she had
turned away, forgetting him and his salvation in
the one absorbing interest of her life.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How long it takes to write a poem! Three
whole months, for he began in September; and
it was not to be a long one, he said.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He means this to be a masterpiece, so labors
like a galley-slave, and can find no rest till it is
done. Good practice, but to little purpose, I am
afraid. Poetry, even the best, is not profitable
now-a-days, I am told,” added Helwyze, speaking
with a sort of satisfaction which he could not
conceal.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Who cares for the profit? It is the fame
Felix wants, and works for,” answered Gladys,
defending the absent with wifely warmth.</p>

<p class='c006'>“True, but he would not reject the fortune if
it came. He is not one of the ethereal sort, who
can live on glory and a crust; his gingerbread
must not only be gilded, but solid and well-spiced
beside. You adore your poet, respect also the
worldly wisdom of your spouse, madame.”</p>

<p class='c006'>When Helwyze sneered, Gladys was silent;
so now she mused again, leaning on the high
back of the chair which she longed to see occupied.
He mused also, with his eyes upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>fire, fingers idly tapping, and a furtive smile
round his mouth, as if some purpose was taking
shape in that busy brain of his. Suddenly he
spoke, in a tone of kindly interest, well knowing
where her thoughts were, and anxious to end
her weary waiting.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Perhaps the poor fellow has fallen asleep,
tired out with striving after immortality. Go
and wake him, if you will, for it is time he
rested.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“May I? He does not like to be disturbed;
but I fear he is ill: he has eaten scarcely any
thing for days, and looks so pale it troubles me.
I will peep first; and if he is busy, creep away
without a word.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Stepping toward the one forbidden, yet most
fascinating spot in all the house, she softly
opened the door and looked in. Canaris was
there, apparently asleep, as Helwyze thought; for
his head lay on his folded arms as if both were
weary. Glancing over her shoulder with a nod
and a smile, Gladys went in, anxious to wake
and comfort him; for the little room looked
solitary, dark, and cold, with dead ashes on the
hearth, the student lamp burning dimly, and the
food she had brought him hours ago still standing
untasted, among the blotted sheets strewn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>all about. At her first touch he looked up,
and she was frightened by the expression of his
face, it was so desperately miserable.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dear, what is it?” she asked, quickly, with
her arms about him, as if defying the unknown
trouble to reach him there.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Disappointment,—nothing else;” and he
leaned his head against her, grateful for sympathy,
since she could give no other help.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You mean your book, which does not satisfy
you even yet?” she said, interpreting the significance
of the weary, yet restless, look he wore.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It never will! I have toiled and tried, with
all my heart and soul and mind, if ever a man
did; but I cannot do it, Gladys. It torments
me, and I cannot escape from it; because, though
it is all here in my brain, it <em>will not</em> be expressed
in words.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do not try any more; rest now, and by and
by, perhaps, it will be easier. You have worked
too hard, and are worn out; forget the book, and
come and let me take care of you. It breaks my
heart to see you so.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I was doing it for your sake,—all for you;
and I thought this time it would be very good,
since my purpose was a just and generous one.
But it is not, and I hate it!”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>With a passionate gesture, Canaris hurled a
pile of manuscript into the further corner of the
room, and pushed his wife from him, as if she
too were an affliction and a disappointment. It
grieved her bitterly; but she would not be repulsed;
and, holding fast in both her own the
hand that was about to grasp another sheaf of
papers, she cried, with a tone of tender authority,
which both controlled and touched him,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, no, you shall not, Felix! Put me away,
but do not spoil the book; it has cost us both
too much.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not you; forgive me, it is myself with
whom I am vexed;” and Canaris penitently
kissed the hands that held his, remembering
that she could not know the true cause of his
effort and regret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I <em>shall</em> be jealous, if I find that I have given
you up so long in vain. I must have something
to repay me for the loss of your society all this
weary time. I have worked to fill your place:
give me my reward.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Have you missed me, then? I thought you
happy enough with Helwyze and the books.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Missed you! happy enough! O Felix! you
do not know me, if you think I <em>can</em> be happy
without you. He is kind, but only a friend; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>all the books in the wide world are not as much
to me as the one you treat so cruelly.” She
clasped tightly the hands she held, and looked
into his face with eyes full of unutterable love.
Such tender flattery could not but soothe, such
tearful reproach fail to soften, a far prouder,
harder man than Canaris.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What reward will you have?” he asked,
making an effort to be cheerful for her sake.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Eat, drink, and rest; then read me every
word you have written. I am no critic; but I
would try to be impartial: love makes even the
ignorant wise, and I shall see the beauty which
I know is in it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I put you there, or tried; so truth and beauty
should be in it. Some time you shall hear it, but
not now. I could not read it to-night, perhaps
never; it is such a poor, pale shadow of the
thing I meant it to be.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let me read it,” said a voice behind them;
and Helwyze stood upon the threshold, wearing
his most benignant aspect.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You?” ejaculated Canaris; while Gladys
shrunk a little, as if the proposition did not
please her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why not? Young poets never read their
own verses well; yet what could be more soothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>to the most timorous or vain than to hear
them read by an admiring and sympathetic
friend? Come, let me have my reward, as well
as Gladys;” and Helwyze laid his hand upon the
unscattered pile of manuscript.</p>

<p class='c006'>“A penance, rather. It is so blurred, so rough,
you could not read it; then the fatigue,”—began
Canaris, pleased, yet reluctant still.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I can read any thing, make rough places
smooth, and not tire, for I have a great interest
in this story. He has shown me some of it, and
it <em>is</em> good.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Helwyze spoke to Gladys, and his last words
conquered her reluctance, whetted her curiosity;
he looked at Canaris, and his glance inspired
hope, his offer tempted, for his voice could make
music of any thing, his praise would be both
valuable and cheering.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let him, Felix, since he is so kind, I so impatient
that I do not want to wait;” and Gladys
went to gather up the leaves, which had flown
wildly about the room.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Leave those, I will sort them while you begin.
The first part is all here. I am sick of it,
and so will you be, before you are through. Go,
love, or I may revoke permission, and make the
bonfire yet.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>Canaris laughed as he waved her away; and
Gladys, seeing that the cloud had lifted, willingly
obeyed, lingering only to give a touch to the
dainty luncheon, which was none the worse for
being cold.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dear, eat and drink, then <em>my</em> feast will be
the sweeter.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I will; I’ll eat and drink stupendously when
you are gone; I wish you <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>bon appetit</i></span>,” he said,
filling the glass, and smiling as he drank.</p>

<p class='c006'>Contented now, Gladys hurried away, to find
Helwyze already seated by the study-table, with
the manuscript laid open before him. He looked
up, wearing an expression of such pleasurable
excitement, that it augured well for what was
coming, and she slipped into the chair beside
the one set ready for Canaris on the opposite
side of the hearth, still hoping he would come
and take it. Helwyze began, and soon she forgot
every thing,—carried away by the smoothly
flowing current of the story which he read so
well. A metrical romance, such as many a lover
might have imagined in the first inspiration of
the great passion, but few could have painted
with such skill. A very human story, but all
the truer and sweeter for that fact. The men
and women in it were full of vitality and color;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>their faces spoke, hearts beat, words glowed;
and they seemed to live before the listener’s eye,
as if endowed with eloquent flesh and blood.</p>

<p class='c006'>Gladys forgot their creator utterly, but Helwyze
did not; and even while reading on with
steadily increasing effect, glanced now and then
towards that inner room, where, after a moment
of unnecessary bustle, perfect silence reigned.
Presently a shadow flickered on the ceiling, a
shadow bent as if listening eagerly, though not
a sound betrayed its approach as it seemed to
glide and vanish behind the tall screen which
stood before the door. Gladys saw nothing,
her face being intent upon the reader, her
thoughts absorbed in following the heart-history
of the woman in whom she could not help finding
a likeness to herself.</p>

<p class='c006'>Helwyze saw the shadow, however, and
laughed inwardly, as if to see the singer irresistibly
drawn by his own music. But no visible
smile betrayed this knowledge; and the tale
went on with deepening power and pathos, till
at its most passionate point he paused.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Go on; oh, pray go on!” cried Gladys,
breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Are you not tired of it?” asked Helwyze;
with a keen look.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>“No, no! You are? Then let me read.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not I; but there is no more here. Ask
Felix if we <em>may</em> go on.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I must! I will! Where is he?” and Gladys
hurried round the screen, to find Canaris flung
down anyway upon a seat, looking almost as
excited as herself.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah,” she cried, delightedly, “you could not
keep away! You know that it is good, and
you are glad and proud, although you will not
own it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Am I? Are you?” he asked, reading the
answer in her face, before she could whisper,
with the look of mingled awe and adoration
which she always wore when speaking of him
as a poet,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Never can I tell you what I feel. It almost
frightens me to find how well you know me and
yourself, and other hearts like ours. What gives
you this wonderful power, and shows you how to
use it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t praise it too much, or I shall wish I
had destroyed, instead of re-sorting, the second
part for you to hear.” Canaris spoke almost
roughly, and rose, as if about to go and do it
now. But Gladys caught his hand, saying gayly,
as she drew him out into the fire-light with persuasive
energy,—</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>“That you shall never do; but come and enjoy
it with us. You need not be so modest, for
you know you like it. Now I am perfectly
happy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She looked so, as she saw her husband sink into
the tall-backed chair, and took her place beside
him, laughing at the almost comic mixture of
sternness, resignation, and impatience betrayed
by his set lips, silent acquiescence, and excited
eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now we are ready;” and Gladys folded her
hands with the rapturous contentment of a child
at its first fairy spectacle.</p>

<p class='c006'>“All but the story. I will fetch it;” and Helwyze
stepped quickly behind the screen before
either could stir.</p>

<p class='c006'>Gladys half rose, but Canaris drew her down
again, whispering, in an almost resentful tone,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let him, if he will; you wait on him too
much. I put the papers in order; he will read
them easily enough.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nay, do not be angry, dear; he does it to
please me, and surely no one could read it better.
I know you would feel too much to do it well,”
she answered, her hand in his, with its most
soothing touch.</p>

<p class='c006'>There was no time for more. Helwyze returned,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>and, after a hasty resettling of the manuscript,
read on, without pausing, to the story’s
end, as if unconscious of fatigue, and bent on
doing justice to the power of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>protégé</i></span> whose
success was his benefactor’s best reward. At
first, Gladys glanced at her husband from time
to time; but presently the living man beside
her grew less real than that other, who, despite
a new name and country, strange surroundings,
and far different circumstances, was so unmistakably
the same, that she could not help feeling
and following his fate to its close, with an interest
almost as intense as if, in very truth, she saw
Canaris going to his end. Her interest in the
woman lessened, and was lost in her eagerness
to have the hero worthy of the love she gave,
the honor others felt for him; and, when the
romance brought him to defeat and death, she
was so wrought upon by this illusion, that she
fell into a passion of sudden tears, weeping as
she had never wept before.</p>

<p class='c006'>Felix sat motionless, his hand over his eyes,
lips closely folded, lest they should betray too
much emotion; the irresistible conviction that
it <em>was</em> good, strengthening every instant, till
he felt only the fascination and excitement of
an hour, which foretold others even more delicious.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>When the tale ended, the melodious
voice grew silent, and nothing was heard but
the eloquent sobbing of a woman. Words seemed
unnecessary, and none were uttered for several
minutes, then Helwyze asked briefly,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Shall we burn it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>As briefly Canaris answered “No;” and
Gladys, quickly recovering the self-control so
seldom lost, looked up with “a face, clear shining
after rain,” as she said in the emphatic tone
of deepest feeling,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“It would be like burning a live thing. But,
Felix, you must not kill that man: I cannot
have him die so. Let him live to conquer all
his enemies, the worst in himself; then, if you
must end tragically, let the woman go; she
would not care, if he were safe.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But she is the heroine of the piece; and, if it
does not end with her lamenting over the fallen
hero, the dramatic point is lost,” said Helwyze;
for Canaris had sprung up, and was walking
restlessly about the room, as if the spirits he
had evoked were too strong to be laid even by
himself.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I know nothing about that; but I feel the
moral point would be lost, if it is not changed.
Surely, powerful as pity is, a lofty admiration is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>better; and this poem would be nobler, in every
way, if that man ends by living well, than by
dying ignominiously in spite of his courage. I
cannot explain it, but I am sure it is so; and
I will not let Felix spoil his best piece of work
by such a mistake.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then you like it? You would be happy if I
changed and let it go before the world, for your
sake more than for my own?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Canaris paused beside her, pale with some
emotion stronger than gratified vanity or ambitious
hope. Gladys thought it was love; and,
carried out of herself by the tender pride that
overflowed her heart and would not be controlled,
she let an action, more eloquent than any
words, express the happiness she was the first
to feel, the homage she would be the first to pay.
Kneeling before him, she clasped her hands together,
and looked up at him with cheeks still
wet, lips still tremulous, eyes still full of wonder,
admiration, fervent gratitude, and love.</p>

<p class='c006'>In one usually so self-restrained as Gladys
such joyful abandonment was doubly captivating
and impressive. Canaris felt it so; and,
lifting her up, pressed her to a heart whose
loud throbbing thanked her, even while he
gently turned her face away, as if he could not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>bear to see and receive such worship from so
pure a source. The unexpected humility in his
voice touched her strangely, and made her feel
more deeply than ever how genuine was the
genius which should yet make him great, as well
as beloved.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I will do what you wish, for you see more
clearly than I. You <em>shall</em> be happy, and I <em>will</em>
be proud of doing it, even if no one else sees any
good in my work.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“They will! they must! It may not be the
grandest thing you will ever do, but it is so
human, it cannot fail to touch and charm; and
to me that is as great an act as to astonish or
dazzle by splendid learning or wonderful wit.
Make it noble as well as beautiful, then people
will love as well as praise you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I will try, Gladys. I see now what I
should have written, and—if I can—it shall be
done.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I promised you inspiration, you remember:
have I not kept my word?” asked Helwyze,
forgotten, and content to be forgotten, until
now.</p>

<p class='c006'>Canaris looked up quickly; but there was
no gratitude in his face, as he answered, with
his hand on the head he pressed against his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>shoulder, and a certain subdued passion in his
voice,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“You have: not the highest inspiration; but,
if <em>she</em> is happy, it will atone for much.”</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c000' />
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>XI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>And Gladys <em>was</em> happy for a little while.
Canaris labored doggedly till all was
finished as she wished. Helwyze lent the aid
which commands celerity; and early in the new
year the book came out, to win for itself and its
author the admiration and regard she had prophesied.
But while the outside world, with which
she had little to do except through her husband,
rejoiced over him and his work, she, in her own
small world, where he was all in all, was finding
cause to wonder and grieve at the change which
took place in him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have done my task, now let me play,” he
said; and play he did, quite as energetically as
he had worked, though to far less purpose.
Praise seemed to intoxicate him, for he appeared
to forget every thing else, and bask in its sunshine,
as if he never could have enough of it.
His satisfaction would have been called egregious
vanity, had it not been so gracefully expressed,
and the work done so excellent that all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>agreed the young man had a right to be proud
of it, and enjoy his reward as he pleased. He
went out much, being again caressed and fêted
to his heart’s content, leaving Gladys to amuse
Helwyze; for a very little of this sort of gayety
satisfied her, and there was something painful
to her in the almost feverish eagerness with
which her husband sought and enjoyed excitement
of all kinds. Glad and proud though she
was, it troubled her to see him as utterly engrossed
as if existence had no higher aim than
the most refined and varied pleasure; and she
began to feel that, though the task was done,
she had not got him back again from that other
mistress, who seemed to have bewitched him with
her dazzling charms.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He will soon have enough of it, and return
to us none the worse. Remember how young
he is; how natural that he should love pleasure
overmuch, when he gets it, since he has had so
little hitherto,” said Helwyze, answering the
silent trouble in the face of Gladys; for she
never spoke of her daily increasing anxiety.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But it does not seem to make him happy;
and for that reason I sometimes think it cannot
be the best kind of pleasure for him,” answered
Gladys, remembering how flushed and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>weary he had been when he came in last night,
so late that it was nearly dawn.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He is one who will taste all kinds, and not
be contented till he has had his fill. Roaming
about Europe with that bad, brilliant father
of his gave him glimpses of many things which
he was too poor to enjoy then, but not too young
to remember and desire now, when it is possible
to gratify the wish. Let him go, he will
come back to you when he is tired. It is the
only way to manage him, I find.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But Gladys did not think so; and, finding that
Helwyze would not speak, she resolved that she
would venture to do it, for many things disturbed
her, which wifely loyalty forbade her to repeat;
as well as a feeling that Helwyze would not
see cause for anxiety in her simple fears, since
he encouraged Felix in this reckless gayety.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some hours later, she found Canaris newly
risen, sitting at his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>escritoire</i></span> in their own room,
with a strew of gold and notes before him, which
he affected to be counting busily; though when
she entered she had seen him in a despondent
attitude, doing nothing.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How pale you look. Why will you stay so
late and get these weary headaches?” she
asked, stroking the thick locks off his forehead
with a caressing touch.</p>

<p class='c006'>sang Canaris, looking up at her with an assumption
of mirth, sadder than the melancholy which
it could not wholly hide.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You make light of it, Felix; but I am sure
you will fall ill, if you do not get more sleep and
quieter dreams,” she said, still smoothing the
glossy dark rings of which she was so proud.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Cara mia</i></span>, what do you know about my
dreams?” he asked, with a hint of surprise in
the manner, which was still careless.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You toss about, and talk so wildly sometimes,
that it troubles me to hear you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I will stop it at once. What do I talk
about? Something amusing, I hope,” he asked,
quickly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That I cannot tell, for you speak in French
or Italian; but you sigh terribly, and often seem
angry or excited about something.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is odd. I do not remember my
dreams, but it is little wonder my poor wits
are distraught, after all they have been through
lately. Did I talk last night, and spoil your
sleep, love?” asked Canaris, idly piling up a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>little heap of coins, though listening intently
for her reply.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes: you seemed very busy, and said more
than once, ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le jeu est fait, rien ne va plus.</span>’
‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rouge gagne et couleur</span>,’—or, ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rouge perd
et couleur gagne</span>.’ I know what those words
mean, because I have read them in a novel;
and they trouble me from your lips, Felix.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I must have been dreaming of a week I once
spent in Homberg, with my father. We don’t
do that sort of thing here.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not under the same name, perhaps. Dear,
do you ever play?” asked Gladys, leaning her
cheek against the head which had sunk a little,
as he leaned forward to smooth out the crumpled
notes before him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why not? One must amuse one’s self.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not so. Please promise that you will try
some safer way? This is not—honest.” She
hesitated over the last word, for his tone had
been short and sharp, but uttered it bravely,
and stole an arm about his neck, mutely asking
pardon for the speech which cost her so much.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What is? Life is all a lottery, and one
must keep trying one’s luck while the wheel
goes round; for prizes are few and blanks
many, you know.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>“Ah, do not speak in that reckless way.
Forgive me for asking questions; but you are all
I have, and I must take care of you, since no one
else has the right.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Or the will. Ask what you please. I will
tell you any thing, my visible conscience;” and
Canaris took her in the circle of his arm, subdued
by the courageous tenderness that made
her what he called her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is that all yours?” she whispered, pointing a
small forefinger rather sternly at the money before
him, and sweetening the question with a kiss.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, it is yours, every penny of it. Put it in
the little drawer, and make merry with it, else I
shall be sorry I won it for you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That I cannot do. Please do not ask me.
There is always enough in the little drawer for
me, and I like better to use the money you have
earned.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Say, rather, the salary which <em>you</em> earn and <em>I</em>
spend. It is all wrong, Gladys; but I cannot
help it!” and Canaris pushed away his winnings,
as if he despised them and himself.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is my fault that you did this, because I
begged you not to let Mr. Helwyze give me so
much. I can take any thing from you, for I love
you, but not from him; so you try to make me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>think you have enough to gratify my every wish.
Is not that true?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes: I hate to have you accept any thing
from him, and find it harder to do so myself,
than before you came. Yet I cannot help liking
play; for it is an inherited taste, and he
knows it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And does not warn you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not he: I inherit my father’s luck as well as
skill, and Helwyze enjoys hearing of my success
in this, as in other things. We used to play
together, till he tired of it. There is nothing
equal to it when one is tormented with <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>ennui</i></span>!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Felix, I fear that, though a kind friend, he is
not a wise one. Why does he encourage your
vices, and take no interest in strengthening your
virtues? Forgive me, but we all have both, and
I want you to be as good as you are gifted,” she
said, with such an earnest, tender face, he could
not feel offended.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He does not care for that. The contest between
the good and evil in me interests him most,
for he knows how to lay his hand on the weak or
wicked spots in a man’s heart; and playing with
other people’s passions is his favorite amusement.
Have you not discovered this?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Canaris spoke gloomily, and Gladys shivered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>as she held him closer, and answered in a
whisper,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, I feel as if under a microscope when
with him; yet he is very kind to me, and very
patient with my ignorance. Felix, is he trying
to discover the evil in me, when he gives me
strange things to read, and sits watching me
while I do it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Gott bewahre!</i></span>—but of this I am sure, he
will find no evil in you, my white-souled little
wife, unless he puts it there. Gladys, refuse to
read what pains and puzzles you. I will not let
him vex your peace. Can he not be content
with me, since I am his, body and soul?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Canaris put her hastily away, to walk the room
with a new sense of wrong hot within him at
the thought of the dangers into which he had
brought her against his will. But Gladys, caring
only for him, ventured to add, with her kindling
eyes upon his troubled face,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“I will not let him vex <em>your</em> peace! Refuse
to do the things which you feel are wrong, lest
what are only pleasures now may become terrible
temptations by and by. I love and trust you
as he never can; I will not believe your vices
stronger than your virtues; and I will defend
you, if he tries to harm the husband God has
given me.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>“Bless you for that! it is so long since I have
had any one to care for me, that I forget my
duty to you. I am tired of all this froth and
folly; I will stay at home hereafter; that will be
safest, if not happiest.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He began impetuously, but his voice fell, and
was almost inaudible at the last word, as he
turned away to hide the expression of regret
which he could not disguise. But Gladys heard
and saw, and the vague fear which sometimes
haunted her stirred again, and took form in the
bitter thought, “Home is not happy: am I the
cause?”</p>

<p class='c006'>She put it from her instantly, as if doubt were
dishonor, and spoke out in the cordial tone which
always cheered and soothed him,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“It shall be both, if I can make it so. Let
me try, and perhaps I can do for you what Mr.
Helwyze says I have done for him,—caused him
to forget his troubles, and be glad he is alive.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Canaris swung round with a peculiar expression
on his face.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He says that, does he? Then he is satisfied
with his bargain! I thought as much, though
he never condescended to confess it to me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What bargain, Felix?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The pair of us. We were costly, but he got
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>us, as he gets every thing he sets his heart upon.
He was growing tired of me; but when I would
have gone, he kept me, by making it possible for
me to win you for myself—and him. Six
months between us have shown you this, I
know, and it is in vain to hide from you how
much I long to break away and be free again—if
I ever can.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He looked ready to break away at once, and
Gladys sympathized with him, seeing now the
cause of his unrest.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I know the feeling, for I too am tired of this
life; not because it is so quiet, but so divided.
I want to live for you alone, no matter how poor
and humble my place may be. Now I am so
little with you, I sometimes feel as if I should
grow less and less to you, till I am nothing but
a burden and a stumbling-block. Can we not
go, and be happy somewhere else? must we stay
here all our lives?” she asked, confessing the
desire which had been strengthening rapidly of
late.</p>

<p class='c006'>“While he lives I must stay, if he wants me.
I cannot be ungrateful. Remember all he has
done for me. It will not be long to wait, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Canaris spoke hurriedly, as if regretting his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>involuntary outburst, and anxious to atone for it
by the submission which always seemed at war
with some stronger, if not nobler, sentiment.
Gladys sat silent, lost in thought; while her husband
swept the ill-gotten money into a drawer,
and locked it up, as if relieved to have it out of
sight. Soon the cloud lifted, however; and going
to him, as he stood at the window, looking out
with the air of a caged eagle, she said, with her
hand upon his arm,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are right: we <em>will</em> be grateful and patient;
but while we wait we must work, because
in that one always finds strength and comfort.
What can we do to earn the wherewithal to
found our own little home upon when this is
gone? I have nothing valuable; have you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nothing but this;” and he touched the
bright head beside him, recalling the moment
when she said her hair was all the gold she had.</p>

<p class='c006'>Gladys remembered it as well, and the promise
then made to help him, both as wife and
woman. The time seemed to have come; and,
taking counsel of her own integrity, she had
dared to speak in the “sincere voice that made
truth sweeter than falsehood.” Now she tried,
in her simple way, to show how the self-respect
he seemed in danger of losing might be preserved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>by a task whose purpose would be both
salvation and reward.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then let the wit inside this head of mine
show you how to turn an honest penny,” she
began, unfolding her plan with an enthusiasm
which redeemed its most prosaic features. “Mr.
Helwyze says that even the best poetry is not
profitable, except in fame. That you already
have; and pride and pleasure in the new book is
enough, without spoiling it by being vexed about
the money it may bring. But you can use your
pen in other ways, before it is time to write
another poem. One of these ways is the translation
of that curious Spanish book you were
speaking of the other day. That will bring
something, as it is rare and old; and you, that
have half a dozen languages at your tongue’s
end, can easily find plenty of such work, now
that you do not absolutely need it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That sounds a little bitter, Gladys. Don’t
let my resentful temper spoil your sweet one.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am learning fast; among other things, that
to him who hath, more shall be given; so you,
being a successful man, may hope for plenty of
help from all <em>now</em>, though you were left to starve,
when a kind word would have saved you so
much suffering,” Gladys answered, not bitterly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>but with a woman’s pitiful memory of the wrongs
done those dearest her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“God knows it would!” ejaculated Canaris,
with unusual fervor.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mr. Helwyze remembers that, I think; and
this is perhaps the reason why he is so generous
now. Too much so for your good, I fear; and so
I speak, because, young as I am, I cannot help
trying to watch over you, as a wife should.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I like it, Gladys. I am old, in many things,
for my years, but a boy still in love, and you
must teach me how to be worthy of all you give
so generously and sweetly.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do I give the most?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“All women do, they say. But go on, and
tell the rest of this fine plan of yours. While I
use my polyglot accomplishments, what becomes
of you?” he asked, hastily returning to the
safer subject; for the wistful look in her eyes
smote him to the heart.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I work also. You are still Mr. Helwyze’s
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>homme d’affaires</i></span>, as he calls you; I am still his
reader. But when he does not need me, I shall
take up my old craft again, and embroider, as
I used at home. You do not know how skilful I
am with the needle, and never dreamed that the
initials on the handkerchiefs you admired so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>much were all my work. Oh, I am a thrifty wife,
though such a little one!” and Gladys broke
into her clear child’s laugh, which seemed to
cheer them both, as a lark’s song makes music
even in a cloud.</p>

<p class='c006'>Canaris laughed with her; for these glimpses
of practical gifts and shrewd common sense in
Gladys were very like the discovery of a rock
under its veil of moss, or garland of airy columbines.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But what will <em>he</em> say to all this?” asked the
young man, with a downward gesture of the
finger, and in his eye a glimmer of malicious
satisfaction at the thought of having at least
one secret in which Helwyze had no part.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We need not tell him. It is nothing to him
what we do up here. Let him find out, if he
cares to know,” answered Gladys, with a charmingly
mutinous air, as she tripped away to her
own little room.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He <em>will</em> care, and he <em>will</em> find out. He has
no right; but that will not stop him,” returned
Canaris, following to lean in the door-way, and
watch her kneeling before a great basket, from
which she pulled reels of gay silk, unfinished
bits of work, and fragments of old lace.</p>

<p class='c006'>“See!” she said, holding up one of the latter,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>“I can both make and mend; and one who is
clever at this sort of thing can earn a pretty
penny in a quiet way. Through my old employer
I can get all the work I want; so please do not
forbid it, Felix: I should be so much happier, if
I might?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I will forbid nothing that makes you happy.
But Helwyze will be exceeding wroth when he
discovers it, unless the absurdity of beggars living
in a palace strikes him as it does me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am not afraid!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You never saw him in a rage: I have. Quite
calm and cool, but rather awful, as he withers
you with a look, or drives you half wild with a
word that stings like a whip, and makes you hate
him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Still I would not fear him, unless I <em>had</em> done
wrong.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He makes you feel so, whether you have or
not; and you ask pardon for doing what you
know is right. It is singular, but he certainly
does make black seem white, sometimes,” mused
Canaris, knitting his brows with the old perplexity.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am afraid so;” and Gladys folded up a
sigh in the parcel of rosy floss she laid away.
Then she chased the frown from her husband’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>face by talking blithely of the home they would
yet earn and enjoy together.</p>

<p class='c006'>Conscious that things were more amiss with
him than she suspected, Canaris was glad to try
the new cure, and soon found it so helpful, that
he was anxious to continue it. Very pleasant were
the hours they spent together in their own
rooms, when the duties they owed Helwyze were
done; all the pleasanter for them, perhaps, because
this domestic league of theirs shut him out
from their real life as inevitably as it drew them
nearer to one another.</p>

<p class='c006'>The task now in hand was one that Canaris
could do easily and well; and Gladys’s example
kept him at it when the charm of novelty was
gone. While he wrote she sat near, so quietly
busy, that he often forgot her presence; but when
he looked up, the glance of approval, the encouraging
word, the tender smile, were always ready,
and wonderfully inspiring; for this sweet comrade
grew dearer day by day. While he rested
she still worked; and he loved to watch the
flowery wonders grow beneath her needle, swift
as skilful. Now a golden wheat-ear, a scarlet
poppy, a blue violet; or the white embroidery,
that made his eyes ache with following the tiny
stitches, which seemed to sow seed-pearls along
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>a hem, weave graceful ciphers, or make lace-work
like a cobweb.</p>

<p class='c006'>Something in it pleased his artistic sense of
the beautiful, and soothed him, as did the conversation
that naturally went on between them.
Oftenest he talked, telling her more of his varied
life than any other human being knew; and in
these confidences she found the clew to many
things which had pained or puzzled her before;
because, spite of her love, Gladys was clear-sighted,
even against her will. Then she would
answer with the story of her monotonous days,
her lonely labors, dreams, and hopes; and they
would comfort one another by making pictures
of a future too beautiful ever to be true.</p>

<p class='c006'>Helwyze was quick to perceive the new change
which came over Felix, the happy peace which
had returned to Gladys. He “did care, and he
did find out,” what the young people were about.
At first he smiled at the girl’s delusion in believing
that she could fix a nature so mercurial
as that of Canaris, but did not wonder at his
yielding, for a time at least, to such tender persuasion;
and, calling them “a pair of innocents,”
Helwyze let them alone, till he discovered that
his power was in danger.</p>

<p class='c006'>Presently, he began to miss the sense of undivided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>control which was so agreeable to him.
Canaris was as serviceable as ever, but no longer
made him sole confidant, counsellor, and friend.
Gladys was scrupulously faithful still, but her intense
interest in his world of books was much lessened:
for she was reading a more engrossing
volume than any of these,—the heart of the man
she loved. Something was gone which he had
bargained for, thought he had secured, and now
felt wronged at losing,—an indescribable charm,
especially pervading his intercourse with Gladys;
for this friendship, sweet as honey, pure as dew,
had just begun to blossom, when a chilly breath
seemed to check its progress, leaving only cheerful
service, not the spontaneous devotion which
had been so much to him.</p>

<p class='c006'>He said nothing; but for all his imperturbability,
it annoyed him, as the gnat annoyed the
lion; and, though scarcely acknowledged even to
himself, it lurked under various moods and motives,
impelling him to words and acts which
produced dangerous consequences.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Pray forgive us, we are very late.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Time goes so fast, we quite forgot!” exclaimed
Felix and Gladys both together, as
they hurried into the library, one bright March
morning, looking so blithe and young, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>Helwyze suddenly felt old and sad and bitter-hearted,
as if they had stolen something from
him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have learned to wait,” he said, with the
cold brevity which was the only sign of displeasure
Gladys ever saw in him.</p>

<p class='c006'>In remorseful silence she hastened to find
her place in the book they were reading; but
Canaris, who seemed bubbling over with good
spirits, took no notice of the chill, and asked,
with unabated cheerfulness,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Any commissions, sir, beside these letters?
I feel as if I ‘could put a girdle round the earth
in forty minutes,’ it is such a glorious, spring-like
day.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nothing but the letters. Stay a moment,
while I add another;” and, taking up the pen he
had laid by, Helwyze wrote hastily,—</p>

<p class='c008'>“<span class='sc'>To Olivia at the South</span>:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“The swallows will be returning soon; return
with them, if you can. I am deadly dull: come
and make a little mischief to amuse me. I miss
you.</p>

<div class='c009'><span class='sc'>Jasper.</span>”</div>

<p class='c006'>Sealing and directing this, he handed it to
Canaris, who had been whispering to Gladys
more like a lover than a husband of half a year’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>standing. Something in the elder man’s face
made the younger glance involuntarily at the
letter as he took it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Olivia? I promised to write her, but I”—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dared not?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No: I forgot it;” and Canaris went off,
laughing at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>grande passion</i></span>, which now
seemed very foolish and far away.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This time, I think, you <em>will</em> remember, for I
mean to fight fire with fire,” thought Helwyze,
with a grim smile, such as Louis XI. might
have worn when sending some gallant young
knight to carry his own death-warrant.</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c000' />
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>XII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>Olivia came before the swallows; for the
three words, “I miss you,” would have
brought her from the ends of the earth, had she
exiled herself so far. She had waited for him to
want and call her, as he often did when others
wearied or failed him. Seldom had so long a
time passed without some word from him; and
endless doubts, fears, conjectures, had harassed
her, as month after month went by, and no
summons came. Now she hastened, ready for
any thing he might ask of her, since her reward
would be a glimpse of the only heaven she
knew.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Amuse Felix: he is falling in love with his
wife, and it spoils both of them for my use. He
says he has forgotten you. Come often, and teach
him to remember, as penalty for his bad taste
and manners,” was the single order Helwyze
gave; but Olivia needed no other; and, for the
sake of coming often, would have smiled upon a
far less agreeable man than Canaris.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>Gladys tried to welcome the new guest cordially,
as an unsuspicious dove might have welcomed
a falcon to its peaceful cote; but her heart
sunk when she found her happy quiet sorely disturbed,
her husband’s place deserted, and the
old glamour slowly returning to separate them, in
spite of all her gentle arts. For Canaris, feeling
quite safe in the sincere affection which now
bound him to his wife, was foolhardy in his
desire to show Olivia how heart-whole he had
become. This piqued her irresistibly, because
Helwyze was looking on, and she would win <em>his</em>
approval at any cost. So these three, from
divers motives, joined together to teach poor
Gladys how much a woman can suffer with
silent fortitude and make no sign.</p>

<p class='c006'>The weeks that followed seemed unusually
gay and sunny ones; for April came in blandly,
and Olivia made a pleasant stir throughout the
house by her frequent visits, and the various
excursions she proposed. Many of these Gladys
escaped; for her pain was not the jealousy that
would drive her to out-rival her rival, but the
sorrowful shame and pity which made her long
to hide herself, till Felix should come back and
be forgiven. Helwyze naturally declined the
long drives, the exhilarating rides in the bright
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>spring weather, which were so attractive to the
younger man, and sat at home watching Gladys,
now more absorbingly interesting than ever. He
could not but admire the patience, strength, and
dignity of the creature; for she made no complaint,
showed no suspicion, asked no advice,
but went straight on, like one who followed with
faltering feet, but unwavering eye, the single
star in all the sky that would lead her right. A
craving curiosity to know what she felt and
thought possessed him, and he invited confidence
by unwonted kindliness, as well as the unfailing
courtesy he showed her.</p>

<p class='c006'>But Gladys would not speak either to him or
to her husband, who seemed wilfully blind to the
slowly changing face, all the sadder for the smile
it always wore when his eyes were on it. At
first, Helwyze tried his gentlest arts; but, finding
her as true as brave, was driven, by the morbid
curiosity which he had indulged till it became a
mania, to use means as subtle as sinful,—like
a burglar, who, failing to pick a lock, grows
desperate and breaks it, careless of consequences.</p>

<p class='c006'>Taking his daily walk through the house, he
once came upon Gladys watering the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>jardinière</i></span>,
which was her especial care, and always kept
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>full of her favorite plants. She was not singing
as she worked, but seriously busy as a child,
holding in both hands her little watering-pot to
shower the thirsty ferns and flowers, who turned
up their faces to be washed with the silent
delight which was their thanks.</p>

<p class='c006'>“See how the dear things enjoy it! I feel as
if they knew and watched for me, and I never
like to disappoint them of their bath,” she said,
looking over her shoulder, as he paused beside
her. She was used to this now, and was never
surprised or startled when below stairs by his
noiseless approach.</p>

<p class='c006'>“They are doing finely. Did Moss bring in
some cyclamens? They are in full bloom now,
and you are fond of them, I think?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, here they are: both purple and white,
so sweet and lovely! See how many buds this
one has. I shall enjoy seeing them come out,
they unfurl so prettily;” and, full of interest,
Gladys parted the leaves to show several baby
buds, whose rosy faces were just peeping from
their green hoods.</p>

<p class='c006'>Helwyze liked to see her among the flowers;
for there was something peculiarly innocent and
fresh about her then, as if the woman forgot her
griefs, and was a girl again. It struck him anew,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>as she stood there in the sunshine, leaning down
to tend the soft leaves and cherish the delicate
buds with a caressing hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Like seeks like: you are a sort of cyclamen
yourself. I never observed it before, but the
likeness is quite striking,” he said, with the slow
smile which usually prefaced some speech which
bore a double meaning.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Am I?” and Gladys eyed the flowers,
pleased, yet a little shy, of compliment from
him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This is especially like you,” continued Helwyze,
touching one of the freshest. “Out of
these strong sombre leaves rises a wraith-like
blossom, with white, softly folded petals, a rosy
color on its modest face, and a most sweet perfume
for those whose sense is fine enough to
perceive it. Most of all, perhaps, it resembles
you in this,—it hides its heart, and, if one tries
to look too closely, there is danger of snapping
the slender stem.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is its nature, and it cannot help being
shy. I kneel down and look up without touching
it; then one sees that it has nothing to hide,”
protested Gladys, following out the flower fancy,
half in earnest, half in jest, for she felt there was
a question and a reproach in his words.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>“Perhaps not; let us see, in my way.” With
a light touch Helwyze turned the reluctant cyclamen
upward, and in its purple cup there clung
a newly fallen drop, like a secret tear.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mute and stricken, Gladys looked at the little
symbol of herself, owning, with a throb of pain,
that if in nothing else, they <em>were</em> alike in
that.</p>

<p class='c006'>Helwyze stood silent likewise, inhaling the
faint fragrance while he softly ruffled the curled
petals as if searching for another tear. Suddenly
Gladys spoke out with the directness which
always gave him a keen pleasure, asking, as she
stretched her hand involuntarily to shield the
more helpless flower,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sir, why do you wish to read my heart?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“To comfort it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do I need comfort, then?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you not?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“If I have a sorrow, God only can console
me, and He only need know it. To you it
should be sacred. Forgive me if I seem ungrateful;
but you cannot help me, if you would.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you doubt my will?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I try to doubt no one; but I fear—I fear
many things;” and, as if afraid of saying too
much, Gladys broke off, to hurry away, wearing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>so strange a look that Helwyze was consumed
with a desire to know its meaning.</p>

<p class='c006'>He saw no more of her till twilight, for Canaris
took her place just then, reading a foreign
book, which she could not manage; but, when
Felix went out, he sought one of his solitary
haunts, hoping she would appear.</p>

<p class='c006'>She did; for the day closed early with a gusty
rain, and the sunset hour was gray and cold,
leaving no after-glow to tint the western sky and
bathe the great room in ruddy light. Pale and
noiseless as a spirit, Gladys went to and fro,
trying to quiet the unrest that made her nights
sleepless, her days one long struggle to be patient,
just, and kind. She tried to sing, but the
song died in her throat; she tried to sew, but
her eyes were dim, and the flower under her
needle only reminded her that “pansies were for
thoughts,” and hers, alas! were too sad for
thinking; she took up a book, but laid it down
again, since Felix was not there to finish it with
her. Her own rooms seemed so empty, she
could not return thither when she had looked for
him in vain; and, longing for some human voice
to speak to her, it was a relief to come upon Helwyze
sitting in his lonely corner,—for she never
now went to the library, unless duty called her.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>“A dull evening, and dull company,” he said,
as she paused beside him, glad to have found
something to take her out of herself, for a time
at least.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Such a long day! and such a dreary night
as it will be!” she answered, leaning her forehead
against the window-pane, to watch the
drops fall, and listen to the melancholy wind.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Shorten the one and cheer the other, as I do:
sleep, dream, and forget.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I cannot!” and there was a world of suffering
in the words that broke from her against her will.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Try my sleep-compeller as freely as I tried
yours. See, these will give you one, if not all
the three desired blessings,—quiet slumber, delicious
dreams, or utter oblivion for a time.”</p>

<p class='c006'>As he spoke, Helwyze had drawn out a little
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>bonbonnière</i></span> of tortoise-shell and silver, which he
always carried, and shaken into his palm half
a dozen white comfits, which he offered to Gladys,
with a benign expression born of real sympathy
and compassion. She hesitated; and he added,
in a tone of mild reproach, which smote her
generous heart with compunction,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Since I may not even try to minister to
your troubled mind, let me, at least, give a little
rest to your weary body. Trust me, child, these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>cannot hurt you; and, strong as you are, you
will break down if you do not sleep.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Without a word, she took them; and, as they
melted on her tongue, first sweet, then bitter, she
stood leaning against the rainy window-pane,
listening to Helwyze, who began to talk as if
he too had tasted the Indian drug, which “made
the face of Coleridge shine, as he conversed like
one inspired.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It seemed a very simple, friendly act; but this
man had learned to know how subtly the mind
works; to see how often an apparently impulsive
action is born of an almost unconscious thought,
an unacknowledged purpose, a deeply hidden
motive, which to many seem rather the child
than the father of the deed. Helwyze did not
deceive himself, and owned that baffled desire
prompted that unpremeditated offer, and was
ready to avail itself of any self-betrayal which
might follow its acceptance, for he had given
Gladys hasheesh.</p>

<p class='c006'>It could not harm; it might soothe and comfort
her unrest. It surely would make her forget
for a while, and in that temporary oblivion perhaps
he might discover what he burned to know.
The very uncertainty of its effect added to the
daring of the deed; and, while he talked, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>waited to see how it would affect her, well knowing
that in such a temperament as hers all
processes are rapid. For an hour he conversed
so delightfully of Rome and its wonders, that
Gladys was amazed to find Felix had come in,
unheard for once.</p>

<p class='c006'>All through dinner she brightened steadily,
thinking the happy mood was brought by her
prodigal’s return, quite forgetting Helwyze and
his bitter-sweet bonbons.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I shall stay at home, and enjoy the society of
my pretty wife. What have you done to make
yourself so beautiful to-night? Is it the new
gown?” asked Canaris, surveying her with
laughing but most genuine surprise and satisfaction
as they returned to the drawing-room again.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is not new: I made it long ago, to please
you, but you never noticed it before,” answered
Gladys, glancing at the pale-hued dress, all
broad, soft folds from waist to ankle, with its
winter trimming of swan’s down at the neck
and wrists; simple, but most becoming to her
flower-like face and girlish figure.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What cruel blindness! But I see and admire
it now, and honestly declare that not Olivia
in all her splendor is arrayed so much to my
taste as you, my Sancta Simplicitas.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>“It is pleasant to hear you say so; but that
alone does not make me happy: it must be
having you at home all to myself again,” she
whispered, with shining eyes, cheeks that glowed
with a deeper rose each hour, and an indescribably
blest expression in a face which now was
both brilliant and dreamy.</p>

<p class='c006'>Helwyze heard what she said, and, fearing to
lose sight of her, promptly challenged Canaris
to chess, a favorite pastime with them both. For
an hour they played, well matched and keenly
interested, while Gladys sat by, already tasting
the restful peace, the delicious dreams, promised
her.</p>

<p class='c006'>The clock was on the stroke of eight, the
game was nearly over, when a quick ring arrested
Helwyze in the act of making the final move.
There was a stir in the hall, then, bringing with
her a waft of fresh, damp air, Olivia appeared,
brave in purple silk and Roman gold.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I thought you were all asleep or dead; but
now I see the cause of this awful silence,” she
cried. “Don’t speak, don’t stir; let me enjoy
the fine tableau you make. Retsch’s ‘Game of
Life,’ quite perfect, and most effective.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It certainly was to an observer; for Canaris,
flushed and eager, looked the young man to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>life; Helwyze, calm but intent, with his finger
on his lip, pondering that last fateful move,
was an excellent Satan; and behind them stood
Gladys, wonderfully resembling the wistful angel,
with that new brightness on her face.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Which wins?” asked Olivia, rustling toward
them, conscious of having made an impressive
entrance; for both men looked up to welcome
her, though Gladys never lifted her eyes from
the mimic battle Felix seemed about to lose.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do, as usual,” answered Helwyze, turning
to finish the game with the careless ease of a
victor.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not this time;” and Gladys touched a piece
which Canaris in the hurry of the moment was
about to overlook. He saw its value at a glance,
made the one move that could save him, and in
an instant cried “Checkmate,” with a laugh of
triumph.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not fair, the angel interfered,” said Olivia,
shaking a warning finger at Gladys, who echoed
her husband’s laugh with one still more exultant,
as she put her hand upon his shoulder, saying, in
a low, intense voice never heard from her lips
before,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have won him; he is mine, and cannot be
taken from me any more.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>“Dearest child, no one wants him, except to
play with and admire,” began Olivia, rather
startled by the look and manner of the lately
meek, mute Gladys.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here Helwyze struck in, anxious to avert
Olivia’s attention; for her undesirable presence
disconcerted him, since her woman’s wit might
discover what it was easy to conceal from Canaris.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You have come to entertain us, like the amiable
enchantress that you are?” he asked, suggestively;
for nothing charmed Olivia more
than permission to amuse him, when others
failed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have a thought,—a happy thought,—if
Gladys will help me. You have given me one
living picture: I will give you others, and she
shall sing the scenes we illustrate.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Take Felix, and give us ‘The God and the
Bayadere,’” said Helwyze, glancing at the young
pair behind them, he intent upon their conversation,
she upon him. “No, I will have
only Gladys. You will act and sing for us, I
know?” and Olivia turned to her with a most
engaging smile.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I never acted in my life, but I will try. I
think I should like it for I feel as if I could do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>any thing to-night;” and she came to them
with a swift step, an eager air, as if longing to
find some outlet for the strange energy which
seemed to thrill every nerve and set her heart
to beating audibly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You look so. Do you know all these
songs?” asked Olivia, taking up the book
which had suggested her happy thought.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There are but four: I know them all. I will
gladly sing them; for I set them to music, if they
had none of their own already. I often do that
to those Felix writes me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come, then. I want the key of the great
press, where you keep your spoils, Jasper.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mrs. Bland will give it you. Order what you
will, if you are going to treat us to an Arabian
Night’s entertainment.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Better than that. We are going to teach a
small poet, by illustrating the work of a great
one;” and, with a mischievous laugh, Olivia vanished,
beckoning Gladys to follow.</p>

<p class='c006'>The two men beguiled the time as best they
might: Canaris playing softly to himself in the
music-room; Helwyze listening intently to the
sounds that came from behind the curtains, now
dropped over a double door-way leading to the
lower end of the hall. Olivia’s imperious voice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>was heard, directing men and maids. More than
once an excited laugh from Gladys jarred upon
his ear; and, as minute after minute passed, his
impatience to see her again increased.</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c000' />
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>XIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>After what would have seemed a wonderfully
short time to a more careless waiter,
three blows were struck, in the French fashion,
and Canaris had barely time to reach his place,
when the deep blue curtains slid noiselessly
apart, showing the visible portion of the hall, arranged
to suggest a mediæval room. An easy
task, when a suit of rusty armor already stood
there; and Helwyze had brought spoils from all
quarters of the globe, in the shape of old furniture,
tapestry, weapons, and trophies of many a
wild hunt.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What is it?” whispered Canaris eagerly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“An Idyl of the King.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I see: the first. How well they look it!”</p>

<p class='c006'>They did; Olivia, as</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c000'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>“An ancient dame in dim brocade;</div>
      <div class='line'>And near her, like a blossom, vermeil-white,</div>
      <div class='line'>That lightly breaks a faded flower-sheath,</div>
      <div class='line'>Stood the fair Enid, all in faded silk.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Gladys, clad in a quaint costume of tarnished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>gray and silver damask, singing, in “the sweet
voice of a bird,”—</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c000'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel, and lower the proud;</div>
      <div class='line'>Turn thy wild wheel through sunshine, storm, and cloud;</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel with smile and frown;</div>
      <div class='line'>With that wild wheel we go not up nor down;</div>
      <div class='line'>Our hoard is little, but our hearts are great.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Smile and we smile, the lords of many lands;</div>
      <div class='line'>Frown and we smile, the lords of our own hands;</div>
      <div class='line'>For man is man and master of his fate.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Turn, turn thy wheel above the staring crowd;</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy wheel and thou art shadows in the cloud;</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>There was something inexpressibly touching
in the way Gladys gave the words, which had
such significance addressed to those who listened
so intently, that they nearly forgot to pay
the tribute which all actors, the greatest as the
least, desire, when the curtain dropped, and the
song was done.</p>

<p class='c006'>“A capital idea of Olivia’s, and beautifully
carried out. This promises to be pleasant;”
and Helwyze sat erect upon the divan, where
Canaris came to lounge beside him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Which comes next? I don’t remember.
If it is Vivien, they will have to skip it, unless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>they call you in for Merlin,” he said, talking
gayly, because a little conscience-stricken by
the look Gladys wore, as she sung, with her eyes
upon him,—</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c000'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Our hoard is little, but our hearts are great.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“They will not want a Merlin; for Gladys
could not act Vivien, if she would,” answered
Helwyze, tapping restlessly as he waited.</p>

<p class='c006'>“She said she could do ‘<em>any thing</em>’ to-night;
and, upon my life, she looked as if she might even
beguile you ‘mighty master,’ of your strongest
spell.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She will never try.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But both were mistaken; for, when they
looked again, the dim light showed a dark and
hooded shape, with glittering eyes and the
semblance of a flowing, hoary beard, leaning
half-hidden in a bower of tall shrubs from the
conservatory. It was Olivia, as Merlin; and,
being of noble proportions, she looked the
part excellently. Upon the wizard’s knee sat
Vivien,—</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c000'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A twist of gold was round her hair;</div>
      <div class='line'>A robe of samite without price, that more exprest</div>
      <div class='line'>Than hid her, clung about her lissome limbs,</div>
      <div class='line'>In color like the satin-shining palm</div>
      <div class='line'>On sallows in the windy gleams of March.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>In any other mood, Gladys would never have
consented to be loosely clad in a great mantle
of some Indian fabric, which shimmered like
woven light, with its alternate stripes of gold-covered
silk and softest wool. Shoulders and arms
showed rosy white under the veil of hair which
swept to her knee, as she clung there, singing
sweet and low, with eyes on Merlin’s face, lips
near his own, and head upon his breast:—</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c000'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“In Love, if Love be Love, if Love be ours,</div>
      <div class='line'>Faith and unfaith can ne’er be equal powers;</div>
      <div class='line'>Unfaith in aught is want of faith in all.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“It is the little rift within the lute</div>
      <div class='line'>That by and by will make the music mute,</div>
      <div class='line'>And ever widening, slowly silence all.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The little rift within the lover’s lute,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or little pitted speck in garner’d fruit,</div>
      <div class='line'>That, rotting inward, slowly moulders all.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“It is not worth the keeping: let it go:</div>
      <div class='line'>But shall it? Answer, darling, answer ‘No;’</div>
      <div class='line'>And trust me not at all or all in all.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>There Gladys seemed to forget her part, and,
turning, stretched her arms towards her husband,
as if in music she had found a tongue to
plead her cause. The involuntary gesture recalled
to her that other verse which Vivien
added to her song; and something impelled her
to sing it, standing erect, with face, figure, voice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>all trembling with the strong emotion that suddenly
controlled her:—</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c000'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“My name, once mine, now thine, is closelier mine,</div>
      <div class='line'>For fame, could fame be mine, that fame were thine;</div>
      <div class='line'>And shame, could shame be thine, that shame were mine;</div>
      <div class='line'>So trust me not at all or all in all.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Down fell the curtain there, and the two men
looked at one another in silence for an instant,
dazzled, troubled, and surprised; for in this
brilliant, impassioned creature they did not
recognize the Gladys they believed they knew
so well.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What possessed her to sing that? She is so
unlike herself, I do not know her,” said Canaris,
excited by the discoveries he was making.</p>

<p class='c006'>“She is inspired to-night; so be prepared for
any thing. These women will work wonders,
they are acting to the men they love,” answered
Helwyze, warily, yet excited also; because, for
him, a double drama was passing on that little
stage, and he found it marvellously fascinating.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I never knew how beautiful she was!”
mused Canaris, half aloud, his eyes upon the
blue draperies which hid her from his sight.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You never saw her in such gear before.
Splendor suits her present mood, as well as simplicity
becomes her usual self-restraint. You
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>have made her jealous, and your angel will prove
herself a woman, after all.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is that the cause of this sudden change in
her? Then I don’t regret playing truant, for
the woman suits me better than the angel,”
cried Canaris, conscious that the pale affection
he had borne his wife so long was already glowing
with new warmth and color, in spite of his
seeming neglect.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wait till you see Olivia as Guinevere. I
know she cannot resist that part, and I suspect
she is willing to efface herself so far that she
may take us by storm by and by.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Helwyze prophesied truly; and, when next
the curtains parted, the stately Queen sat in the
nunnery of Almesbury, with the little novice at
her feet. Olivia <em>was</em> right splendid now, for her
sumptuous beauty well became the costly stuffs
in which she had draped herself with the graceful
art of a woman whose physical loveliness was
her best possession. A trifle <em>too</em> gorgeous, perhaps,
for the repentant Guinevere; but a most
grand and gracious spectacle, nevertheless, as
she leaned in the tall carved chair, with jewelled
arms lying languidly across her lap, and
absent eyes still full of love and longing for lost
Launcelot.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>Gladys, in white wimple and close-folded gown
of gray, sat on a stool beside the “one low light,”
humming softly, her rosary fallen at her feet,—</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c000'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>“the Queen looked up, and said,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>‘O maiden, if indeed you list to sing</div>
      <div class='line'>Sing, and unbind my heart, that I may weep.’</div>
      <div class='line'>Whereat full willingly sang the little maid,</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>Late, late, so late! and dark the night and chill!</div>
      <div class='line'>Late, late, so late! but we can enter still.</div>
      <div class='line'>Too late! too late! ye cannot enter now.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>No light had we: for that we do repent,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, learning this, the bridegroom will relent.</div>
      <div class='line'>Too late! too late! ye cannot enter now.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>No light, so late! and dark and chill the night!</div>
      <div class='line'>O let us in, that we may find the light!</div>
      <div class='line'>Too late! too late! ye cannot enter now.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Have we not heard the bridegroom is so sweet?</div>
      <div class='line'>O let us in, tho’ late, to kiss his feet!</div>
      <div class='line'>No, no, too late! ye cannot enter now.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Slowly the proud head had drooped, the stately
figure sunk, till, as the last lament died away,
nothing remained of splendid Guinevere but a
hidden face, a cloud of black hair from which
the crown had fallen, a heap of rich robes quivering
with the stormy sobs of a guilty woman’s
smitten heart. The curtains closed on this
tableau, which was made the more effective by
the strong contrast between the despairing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>Queen and the little novice telling her beads in
meek dismay.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good heavens, that sounded like the wail of
a lost soul! My blood runs cold, and I feel as if
I ought to say my prayers,” muttered Canaris,
with a shiver; for, with his susceptible temperament,
music always exerted over him an almost
painful power.</p>

<p class='c006'>“If you knew any,” sneered Helwyze, whose
eyes now glittered with something stronger than
excitement.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do: Gladys taught me, and I am not
ashamed to own it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Much good may it do you.” Then, in a
quieter tone, he asked, “Is there any song in
‘Elaine’? I forget; and that is the only one we
have not had.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“There is ‘The Song of Love and Death.’
Gladys was learning it lately; and, if I remember
rightly, it was heart-rending. I hope she
will not sing it, for this sort of thing is rather
too much for me;” and Canaris got up to wander
aimlessly about, humming the gayest airs he
knew, as if to drown the sorrowful “Too late!
too late!” still wailing in his ear.</p>

<p class='c006'>By this time Gladys was no longer quite herself:
an inward excitement possessed her, a wild
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>desire to sing her very heart out came over her,
and a strange chill, which she thought a vague
presentiment of coming ill, crept through her
blood. Every thing seemed vast and awful;
every sense grew painfully acute; and she walked
as in a dream, so vivid, yet so mysterious, that
she did not try to explain it even to herself. Her
identity was doubled: one Gladys moved and
spoke as she was told,—a pale, dim figure, of
no interest to any one; the other was alive in
every fibre, thrilled with intense desire for something,
and bent on finding it, though deserts,
oceans, and boundless realms of air were passed
to gain it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Olivia wondered at her unsuspected power,
and felt a little envious of her enchanting gift.
But she was too absorbed in “setting the stage,”
dressing her prima donna, and planning how to
end the spectacle with her favorite character of
Cleopatra, to do more than observe that Gladys’s
eyes were luminous and large, her face growing
more and more colorless, her manner less and
less excited, yet unnaturally calm.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This is the last, and you have the stage
alone. Do your best for Felix; then you shall
rest and be thanked,” she whispered, somewhat
anxiously, as she placed Elaine in her tower,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>leaning against the dark screen, which was unfolded,
to suggest the casement she flung back
when Launcelot passed below,—</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c000'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>“And glanced not up, nor waved his hand,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor bade farewell, but sadly rode away.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The “lily maid of Astolat” could not have looked
more wan and weird than Gladys, as she stood
in her trailing robes of dead white, with loosely
gathered locks, hands clasped over the gay bit of
tapestry which simulated the cover of the shield,
eyes that seemed to see something invisible to
those about her, and began her song, in a veiled
voice, at once so sad and solemn, that Helwyze
held his breath, and Canaris felt as if she called
him from beyond the grave:—</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c000'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Sweet is true love, tho’ given in vain, in vain;</div>
      <div class='line'>And sweet is death, who puts an end to pain;</div>
      <div class='line'>I know not which is sweeter, no, not I.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Love, art thou sweet? then bitter death must be;</div>
      <div class='line'>Love, thou art bitter; sweet is death to me.</div>
      <div class='line'>O Love, if death be sweeter, let me die.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Sweet love, that seems not made to fade away,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sweet death, that seems to make us loveless clay,</div>
      <div class='line'>I know not which is sweeter, no, not I.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I fain would follow love, if that could be;</div>
      <div class='line'>I needs must follow death, who calls for me:</div>
      <div class='line'>Call and I follow, I follow! let me die!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>Carried beyond self-control by the unsuspected
presence of the drug, which was doing its work
with perilous rapidity, Gladys, remembering only
that the last line should be sung with force, and
that she sung for Felix, obeyed the wild impulse
to let her voice rise and ring out with a shrill,
despairing power and passion, which startled
every listener, and echoed through the room, like
Elaine’s unearthly cry of hapless love and death.</p>

<p class='c006'>Olivia dropped her asp, terrified; the maids
stared, uncertain whether it was acting or insanity;
and Helwyze sprung up aghast, fearing that
he had dared too much. But Canaris, seeing
only the wild, woful eyes fixed on his, the hands
wrung as if in pain, forgot every thing but
Gladys, and rushed between the curtains, exclaiming
in real terror,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t look so! don’t sing so! my God, she
is dying!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Not dying, only slipping fast into the unconscious
stage of the hasheesh dream, whose coming
none can foretell but those accustomed to its
use. Pale and quiet she lay in her husband’s
arms, with half-open eyes and fluttering breath,
smiling up at him so strangely that he was
bewildered as well as panic-stricken. Olivia
forgot her Cleopatra to order air and water; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>maids flew for salts and wine; Helwyze with
difficulty hid his momentary dismay; while Canaris,
almost beside himself, could only hang
over the couch where lay “the lily-maid,” looking
as if already dead, and drifting down to Camelot.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Gladys, do you know me?” he cried, as a
little color came to her lips after the fiery
draught Olivia energetically administered.</p>

<p class='c006'>The eyes opened wider, the smile grew
brighter, and she lifted her hand to bring him
nearer, for he seemed immeasurably distant.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Felix! Let me be still, quite still; I want
to sleep. Good-night, good-night.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She thought she kissed him; then his face
receded, vanished, and, as she floated buoyantly
away upon the first of the many oceans to be
crossed in her mysterious quest, a far-off voice
seemed to say, solemnly, as if in a last farewell,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hush! let her sleep in peace.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was Helwyze; and, having felt her pulse, he
assured them all that she was only over-excited,
must rest an hour or two, and would soon be
quite herself again. So the brief panic ended
quietly; and, having lowered the lights, spread
Guinevere’s velvet mantle over her, and re-assured
themselves that she was sleeping calmly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>the women went to restore order to ante-room
and hall, Canaris sat down to watch beside
Gladys, and Helwyze betook himself to the
library.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is she still sleeping?” he asked, with unconcealable
anxiety, when Olivia joined him
there.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Like a baby. What a high-strung little
thing it is. If she had strength to bear the
training, she would make a cantatrice to be
proud of, Jasper.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah, but she never would! Fancy that modest
creature on a stage for all the world to gape
at. She was happiest in the nun’s gown to-night,
though simply ravishing as Vivien. The
pretty, bare feet were most effective; but how
did you persuade her to it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I had no sandals as a compromise: I therefore
insisted that the part <em>must</em> be so dressed or
undressed, and she submitted. People usually
do, when I command.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She was on her mettle: I could see that;
and well she might be, with you for a rival. I
give you my word, Olivia, if I did not know you
were nearly forty, I should swear it was a lie;
for ‘age cannot wither nor custom stale’ my
handsome Cleopatra. We ought to have had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>that, by the by: it used to be your best bit. I
could not be your Antony, but Felix might: he
adores costuming, and would do it capitally.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not old enough. Ah! what happy times
those were;” and Olivia sighed sincerely, yet
dramatically, for she knew she was looking
wonderfully well, thrown down upon a couch,
with her purple skirts sweeping about her, and
two fine arms banded with gold clasped over her
dark head.</p>

<p class='c006'>Helwyze had flattered with a purpose. Canaris
was in the way, Gladys might betray herself,
and all was not safe yet; though in one respect
the experiment had succeeded admirably, for he
still tingled with the excitement of the evening.
Now he wanted help, not sentiment, and, ignoring
the sigh, said, carelessly,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“If all obey when you insist, just make Felix
go home with you. The drive will do him good,
for he is as nervous as a woman, and I shall
have him fidgeting about all night, unless he forgets
his fright.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But Gladys?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She will be the better for a quiet nap, and
ready, by the time he returns, to laugh at her
heroics. He will only disturb her if he sits
there, like a mourner at a death-bed.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>“That sounds sensible and friendly, and you
do it very well, Jasper; but I am impressed that
something is amiss. What is it? Better tell
me; I shall surely find it out, and will not work
in the dark. I see mischief in your eyes, and
you cannot deceive me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Olivia spoke half in jest; but she had so often
seen his face without a mask, that it was difficult
to wear one in her presence. He frowned, hesitated,
then fearing she would refuse the favor if
he withheld the secret, he leaned towards her
and answered in a whisper,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“I gave Gladys hasheesh, and do not care to
have Felix know it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Jasper, how dared you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She was restless, suffering for sleep. I know
what that is, and out of pity gave her the
merest taste. Upon my honor, no more than a
child might safely take. She did not know
what it was, and I thought she would only feel
its soothing charm. She would, if it had not
been for this masquerading. I did not count on
that, and it was too much for her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Will she not suffer from the after-effects?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not a whit, if she is let alone. An hour
hence she will be deliciously drowsy, and to-morrow
none the worse. I had no idea it would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>affect her so powerfully; but I do not regret it,
for it showed what the woman is capable of.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“At your old tricks. You will never learn to
let your fellow-creatures alone, till something
terrible stops you. You were always prying
into things, even as a boy, when I caught butterflies
for you to look at.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I never killed them: only brushed off a trifle
of the gloss by my touch, and let them go again,
none the worse, except for the loss of a few invisible
feathers.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah! but that delicate plumage is the glory of
the insect; robbed of that, its beauty is marred.
No one but their Maker can search hearts without
harming them. I wonder how it will fare
with yours when He looks for its perfection?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Olivia spoke with a sudden seriousness, a
yearning look, which jarred on nerves already
somewhat unstrung, and Helwyze answered, in
a mocking tone that silenced her effectually,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am desperately curious to know. If I can
come and tell you, I will: such pious interest
deserves that attention.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Heaven forbid!” ejaculated Olivia, with a
shiver.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then I will <em>not</em>. I have been such a poor
ghost here, I suspect I shall be glad to rest eternally
when I once fall asleep, if I can.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>Weary was his voice, weary his attitude, as,
leaning an elbow on either knee, he propped his
chin upon his hands, and sat brooding for a
moment with his eyes upon the ground, asking
himself for the thousandth time the great question
which only hope and faith can answer truly.</p>

<p class='c006'>Olivia rose. “You are tired; so am I. Good-night,
Jasper, and pleasant dreams. But remember,
no more tampering with Gladys, or I must
tell her husband.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have had my lesson. Take Felix with you,
and I will send Mrs. Bland to sit with her till he
comes back. Good-night, my cousin; thanks
for a glimpse of the old times.” Such words,
uttered with a pressure of the hand, conquered
Olivia’s last scruple, and she went away to prefer
her request in a form which made it impossible
for Canaris to refuse. Gladys still slept
quietly. The distance was not long, the fresh air
grateful, Olivia her kindest self, and he obeyed,
believing that the motherly old woman would
take his place as soon as certain housewifely
duties permitted.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then Helwyze did an evil thing,—a thing few
men could or would have done. He deliberately
violated the sanctity of a human soul, robbing
it alike of its most secret and most precious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>thoughts. Hasheesh had lulled the senses which
guarded the treasure; now the magnetism of a
potent will forced the reluctant lips to give up
the key.</p>

<p class='c006'>Like a thief he stole to Gladys’ side, took in
his the dimpled hands whose very childishness
should have pleaded for her, and fixed his eyes
upon the face before him, untouched by its helpless
innocence, its unnatural expression. The
half-open eyes were heavy as dew-drunken
violets, the sweet red mouth was set, the agitated
bosom still rose and fell, like a troubled sea
subsiding after storm.</p>

<p class='c006'>So sitting, stern and silent as the fate he believed
in, Helwyze concentrated every power
upon the accomplishment of the purpose to
which he bent his will. He called it psychological
curiosity; for not even to himself did he dare
confess the true meaning of the impulse which
drove him to this act, and dearly did he pay
for it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Soon the passive palms thrilled in his own, the
breath came faint and slow, color died, and life
seemed to recede from the countenance, leaving a
pale effigy of the woman; lately so full of vitality.
“It works! it works!” muttered Helwyze, lifting
his head at length to wipe the dampness from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>his brow, and send a piercing glance about the
shadowy room. Then, kneeling down beside the
couch, he put his lips to her ear, whispering in a
tone of still command,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Gladys, do you hear me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Like the echo of a voice, so low, expressionless,
and distant was it, the answer came,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“I hear.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Will you answer me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I must.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You have a sorrow,—tell it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“All is so false. I am unhappy without
confidence,” sighed the voice.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Can you trust no one?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No one here, but Felix.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yet he deceives, he does not love you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He will.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is this the hope which sustains you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And you forgive, you love him still?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Always.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“If the hope fails?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It will not: I shall have help.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What help?”</p>

<p class='c006'>No answer now, but the shadow of a smile
seemed to float across the silent lips as if reflected
from a joy too deep and tender for
speech to tell.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>“Speak! what is this happiness? The hope
of freedom?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It will come.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“When you die.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He caught his breath, and for an instant
seemed daunted by the truth he had evoked;
for it was terrible, so told, so heard.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You hate me, then?” he whispered, almost
fiercely, in the ear that never shrank from his
hot lips.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I doubt and dread you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, Gladys, why? To you I am not cruel.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Too kind, alas, too kind!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And yet you fear me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“God help us. Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What is your fear?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, no, I will <em>not</em> tell it!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Some inward throe of shame or anguish
turned the pale face paler, knotted the brow,
and locked the lips, as if both soul and body
revolted from the thought thus ruthlessly
dragged to light. Instinct, the first, last, strongest
impulse of human nature, struggled blindly
to save the woman from betraying the dread
which haunted her heart like a spectre, and
burned her lips in the utterance of its name.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>But Helwyze was pitiless, his will indomitable;
his eye held, his hand controlled, his voice commanded;
and the answer came, so reluctantly,
so inaudibly, that he seemed to divine, not
hear it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What fear?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Your love.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You see, you know it, then?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do not see, I vaguely feel; I pray God I
may never know.”</p>

<p class='c006'>With the involuntary recoil of a guilty joy,
a shame as great, Helwyze dropped the nerveless
hands, turned from the mutely accusing
face, let the troubled spirit rest, and asked no
more. But his punishment began as he stood
there, finding the stolen truth a heavier burden
than baffled doubt or desire had been; since forbidden
knowledge was bitter to the taste, forbidden
love possessed no sweetness, and the
hidden hope, putting off its well-worn disguise,
confronted him in all its ugliness.</p>

<p class='c006'>An awesome silence filled the room, until he
lifted up his eyes, and looked at Gladys with a
look which would have wrung her heart could
she have seen it. She did not see; for she lay
there so still, so white, so dead, he seemed to
have scared away the soul he had vexed with his
impious questioning.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>In remorseful haste, Helwyze busied himself
about her, till she woke from that sleep within a
sleep, moaned wearily, closed the unseeing eyes,
and drifted away into more natural slumber,
dream-haunted, but deep and quiet.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then he stole away as he had come, and, sending
the old woman to watch Gladys, shut himself
into his own room, to keep a vigil which
lasted until dawn; for all the poppies of the East
could not have brought oblivion that night.</p>
<div class='pbb'>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>XIV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>It seemed as if some angel had Gladys in
especial charge, bringing light out of darkness,
joy out of sorrow, good out of evil; for no
harm came to her,—only a great peace, which
transfigured her face till it was as spiritually
beautiful, as that of some young Madonna.</p>

<p class='c006'>Waking late the next day she remembered
little of the past night’s events, and cared to remember
little, having clearer and calmer thoughts
to dwell upon, happier dreams to enjoy.</p>

<p class='c006'>She suspected Helwyze of imprudent kindness,
but uttered no reproach, quite unconscious
of how much she had to forgive; thereby innocently
adding to both the relief and the remorse
he felt. The doubt and dread which had risen
to the surface at his command, seemed to sink
again into the depths; and hope and love, to still
the troubled waters where her life-boat rode at
anchor for a time.</p>

<p class='c006'>Canaris, as if tired of playing truant, was
ready now to be forgiven; more conscious than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>ever before that this young wife was a possession
to be proud of, since, when she chose, she
could eclipse even Olivia. The jealousy which
could so inspire her flattered his man’s vanity,
and made her love more precious; for not yet had
he learned all its depth, nor how to be worthy of
it. The reverence he had always felt increased
fourfold, but the affection began to burn with a
stronger flame; and Canaris, for the first time,
tasted the pure happiness of loving another
better than himself. Glad to feel, yet ashamed
to own, a sentiment whose sincerity made it
very sweet, he kept it to himself, and showed no
sign, except a new and most becoming humility
of manner when with Gladys, as if silently asking
pardon for many shortcomings. With Helwyze
he was cold and distant, evidently dreading
to have him discover the change he had foretold,
and feeling as if his knowledge of it would profane
the first really sacred emotion the young
man had known since his mother died.</p>

<p class='c006'>Anxious for some screen behind which to
hide the novel, yet most pleasurable, sensations
which beset him, he found Olivia a useful friend,
and still kept up some semblance of the admiration,
out of which all dangerous ardor was fast
fading. She saw this at once, and did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>regret it: for she had a generous nature, which
an all-absorbing and unhappy passion had not
entirely spoiled.</p>

<p class='c006'>Obedience to Helwyze was her delight; but,
knowing him better than any other human being
could, she was troubled by his increasing interest
in Gladys, more especially since discovering
that the girl possessed the originality, fire, and
energy which were more attractive to him than
her youth, gentleness, or grace. Jealousy was
stronger than the desire to obey; and, calling it
compassion, Olivia resolved to be magnanimous,
and spare Gladys further pain, letting Canaris
return to his allegiance, as he seemed inclined
to do, unhindered by any act of hers.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The poor child is so young, so utterly unable
to cope with me, it is doubly cruel to torment
her, just to gratify a whim of Jasper’s. Better
make my peace handsomely, and be her friend,
than rob her of the only treasure she possesses,
since I do not covet it,” she thought, driving
through the May-day sunshine, to carry Jasper the
earliest sprays of white and rosy hawthorn from
the villa garden, whither she had been to set all
in order for the summer.</p>

<p class='c006'>Helwyze was not yet visible; and, full of her
new design, Olivia hastened up to find Gladys,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>meaning by some friendly word, some unmistakable
but most delicate hint, to reassure her
regarding the errant young husband, whom she
had not yet learned to hold.</p>

<p class='c006'>There was no answer to her hasty tap, and
Olivia went in to seek yet further. Half-way
across the larger apartment she paused abruptly,
and stood looking straight before her,
with a face which passed rapidly from its first
expression of good-will to one of surprise, then
softened, till tears stood in the brilliant eyes,
and some sudden memory or thought made that
usually proud countenance both sad and tender.</p>

<p class='c006'>Gladys sat alone in her little room, her work
lying on her knee, her arms folded, her head bent,
singing to herself as she rocked to and fro, lost
in some reverie that made her lips smile faintly,
and her voice very low. She often sat so now,
but Olivia had never seen her thus; and, seeing,
divined at once the hope which lifted her above
all sorrow, the help sent by Heaven, when most
she needed it. For the song Gladys sang was a
lullaby, the look she wore was that which comes
to a woman’s face when she rocks her first-born
on her knee, and above her head was a new
picture, an angel, with the Lily of Annunciation
in its hand.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>The one precious memory of Olivia’s stormy
life was the little daughter, who for a sweet,
short year was all in all to her, and whose small
grave was yearly covered with the first spring
flowers. Fresh from this secret pilgrimage, the
woman’s nature was at its noblest now; and
seeing that other woman, so young, so lonely,
yet so blest, her heart yearned over her,—</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c000'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“All her worser self slipped from her</div>
      <div class='line'>Like a robe,”—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>and, hurrying in, she said, impulsively,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“O child, I wish you had a mother!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Gladys looked up, unstartled from the calm
in which she dwelt. Olivia’s face explained her
words, and she answered them with the only reproach
much pain had wrung from her,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“<em>You</em> might have been one to me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is not too late! What shall I do to prove
my sincerity?” cried Olivia, stricken with remorse.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Help me to give my little child an honest
father.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I will! show me how.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Then these two women spent a memorable
hour together; for the new tie of motherhood
bridged across all differences of age and character,
made confession easy, confidence sweet,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>friendship possible. Yet, after all, Gladys was
the comforter, Olivia the one who poured out
her heart, and found relief in telling the sorrows
that had been, the temptations that still beset
her, the good that yet remained to answer, when
the right chord was touched. She longed to
give as much as she received; but when she
had owned, with a new sense of shame, that she
was merely playing with Canaris for her own
amusement (being true to Helwyze even in her
falsehood), there seemed no more for her to do,
since Gladys asked but one other question, and
that she could not answer.</p>

<p class='c006'>“If he does not love you, and, perhaps, it is as
you say,—only a poet’s admiration for beauty,—what
<em>is</em> the trouble that keeps us apart? At
first I was too blindly happy to perceive it; now
tears have cleared my eyes, and I see that he
hides something from me,—something which he
longs, yet dares not tell.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I know: I saw it long ago; but Jasper alone
can tell that secret. He holds Felix by it, and
I fear the knowledge would be worse than the
suspicion. Let it be: time sets all things right,
and it is ill thwarting my poor cousin. I have
a charming plan for you and Felix; and, when
you have him to yourself, you may be able to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>win his confidence, as, I am sure, you have
already won his heart.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Then Olivia told her plan, which was both
generous and politic; since it made Gladys truly
happy, proved her own sincerity, secured her
own peace and that of the men whose lives
seemed to become more and more inextricably
tangled together.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now I shall go to Jasper, and conquer all
his opposition; for I know I am right. Dear
little creature, what is it about you that makes
one feel both humble and strong when one is
near you?” asked Olivia, looking down at Gladys
with a hand on either shoulder, and genuine
wonder in the eyes still soft with unwonted
tears.</p>

<p class='c006'>“God made me truthful, and I try to keep so;
that is all,” she answered, simply.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is enough. Kiss me, Gladys, and make
me better. I am not good enough to be the
mother that I might have been to you; but I
<em>am</em> a friend; believe that, and trust me, if you
can?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do;” and Gladys sealed her confidence with
both lips and hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Jasper, I have invited those children to
spend the summer at the villa, since you have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>decided for the sea. Gladys is mortally tired of
this hot-house life, so is Felix: give them a long
holiday, or they will run away together. Mrs.
Bland and I will take care of you till they come
back.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Olivia walked in upon Helwyze with this
abrupt announcement, well knowing that persuasion
would be useless, and vigorous measures
surest to win the day. Artful as well as courageous
in her assault, she answered in that one
speech several objections against her plan, and
suggested several strong reasons for it, sure
that he would yield the first, and own the
latter.</p>

<p class='c006'>He did, with unexpected readiness; for a motive
which she could not fathom prompted his
seemingly careless acquiescence. He had no
thought of relinquishing his hold on Canaris,
since through him alone he held Gladys; but
he often longed to escape from both for a time,
that he might study and adjust the new power
which had come into his life, unbidden, undesired.
Surprise and disappointment were almost
instantaneously followed by a sense of
relief when Olivia spoke; for he saw at once
that this project was a wiser one than she
knew.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>Before her rapid sentences were ended, the
thought had come and gone, the decision was
made, and he could answer, in a tone of indifference
which both pleased and perplexed her,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Amiable woman, with what helpful aspirations
are you blest. Seeing your failure with
Felix, I have been wondering how I should get
rid of him till he recovers from this comically
tardy passion for his wife. They can have
another and a longer honeymoon up at the
villa, if they like: the other was far from romantic,
I suspect. Well, why that sphinx-like
expression, if you please?” he added, as Olivia
stood regarding him from behind the fading
hawthorn which she forgot to offer.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I was wondering if I should ever understand
you, Jasper.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Doubtful, since I shall never understand
myself.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You ought, if any man; for you spend your
life in studying yourself.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And the more I study, the less I know. It
is very like a child with a toy ark: I never
know what animal may appear first. I put in
my hand for a dove, and I get a serpent; I open
the door for the sagacious elephant, and out
rushes a tiger; I think I have found a favorite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>dog, and it is a wolf, looking ready to devour me.
An unsatisfactory toy, better put it away and
choose another.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Helwyze spoke in the half-jesting, half-serious
way habitual to him; but though his mouth
smiled, his eyes were gloomy, and Olivia hastened
to turn his thoughts from a subject in
which he took a morbid interest.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Fanciful, but true. Now, follow your own
excellent advice, and find wholesome amusement
in helping me pack off the young people, and
then ourselves. It is not too early for them to
go at once. Canaris can come in and out as you
want him for a month longer, then I will have
all things ready for you in the old cottage by the
sea. You used to be happy there: can you not
be so again?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“If you can give me back my twenty years.
May-day is over for both of us; why try to make
the dead hawthorn bloom again? Carry out
your plan, and let the children be happy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>They <em>were</em> very happy; for the prospect of
entire freedom was so delicious, that Gladys had
some difficulty in concealing her delight, while
Canaris openly rejoiced when told of Olivia’s
offer. All dinner-time he was talking of it; and
afterward, under pretence of showing her a new
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>plant, he took his wife into the conservatory,
that he might continue planning how they should
spend this unexpected holiday.</p>

<p class='c006'>Helwyze saw them wandering arm in arm;
Canaris talking rapidly, and Gladys listening,
with happy laughter, to his whimsical suggestions
and projects. Their content displeased the
looker-on; but there was something so attractive
in the flower-framed picture of beauty, youth,
and joy, that he could not turn his eyes away,
although the sight aroused strangely conflicting
thoughts within him.</p>

<p class='c006'>He wished them gone, yet dreaded to lose the
charm of his confined life, feeling that absence
would inevitably become estrangement. Canaris
never would be entirely his again; for he was
slowly climbing upward into a region where false
ambition could not blind, mere pleasure satisfy,
nor license take the place of liberty. He had
not planned to ruin the youth, but simply to let
“the world, the flesh, and the devil” contend
against such virtues as they found, while he sat
by and watched the struggle.</p>

<p class='c006'>As Olivia predicted, however, power was a
dangerous gift to such a man; and, having come
to feel that Canaris belonged to him, body and
soul, he was ill-pleased at losing him just when a
new interest was added to their lives.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>Yet losing him he assuredly was; and something
like wonder mingled with his chagrin, for
this girl, whom he had expected to mould to his
will, exerted over him, as well as Canaris, a soft
control which he could neither comprehend nor
conquer. Its charm was its unconsciousness, its
power was its truth; for it won gently and held
firmly the regard it sought. She certainly did
possess the gift of surprises; for, although
brought there as a plaything, “little Gladys,”
without apparent effort, had subjugated haughty
Olivia, wayward Felix, ruthless Helwyze; and
none rebelled against her. She ruled them by
the irresistible influence of a lovely womanhood,
which made her daily life a sweeter poem than
any they could write.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why did I not keep her for myself? If she
can do so much for him, what might she not
have done for me, had I been wise enough to
wait,” thought Helwyze, watching the bright-haired
figure that stood looking up to the green
roof whence Canaris was gathering passion-flowers.</p>

<p class='c006'>As if some consciousness of his longing
reached her, Gladys turned to look into the
softly lighted room beyond, and, seeing its master
sit there solitary in the midst of its splendor, she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>obeyed the compassionate impulse which was
continually struggling against doubt and dislike.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It must seem very selfish and ungrateful in
us to be so glad. Come, Felix, and amuse him
as well as me,” she said, in a tone meant for his
ear alone. But Helwyze heard both question
and answer.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have been court-fool long enough. ’Tis a
thankless office, and I am tired of it,” replied
Canaris, in the tone of a prisoner asked to go
back when the door of his cell stands open.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<em>I</em> must go, for there is Jean with coffee.
Follow, like a good boy, when you have put your
posy into a song, which I will set to music by
and by, as your reward,” said Gladys, turning
reluctantly away.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You make goodness so beautiful, that it is
easy to obey. There is my posy set to music at
once, for you are a song without words, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><i>cariña</i></span>;”
and Canaris threw the vine about her neck, with
a look and a laugh which made it hard for her
to go.</p>

<p class='c006'>Jean not only brought coffee, but the card of
a friend for Felix, who went away, promising to
return. Gladys carefully prepared the black and
fragrant draught which Helwyze loved, and presented
it, with a sweet friendliness of mien
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>which would have made hemlock palatable, he
thought.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Shall I sing to you till Felix comes to give
you something better?” she asked, offering her
best, as if anxious to atone for the sin of being
happy at the cost of pain to another.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Talk a little first. There will be time for
both before he remembers us again,” answered
Helwyze, motioning her to a seat beside him,
with the half-imperative, half-courteous, look and
gesture habitual to him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He will not forget: Felix always keeps his
promises to me,” said Gladys, with an air of
gentle pride, taking her place, not beside, but
opposite, Helwyze, on the couch where Elaine
had laid not long ago.</p>

<p class='c006'>This involuntary act of hers gave a tone to the
conversation which followed; for Helwyze, being
inwardly perturbed, was seized with a desire to
hover about dangerous topics: and, seeing her
sit there, so near and yet so far, so willing to serve,
yet so completely mistress of herself, longed to
ruffle that composure, if only to make her share
the disquiet of which she was the cause.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Always?” he said, lifting his brows with an
incredulous expression, as he replied to her assertion.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>“I seldom ask any promise of him, but when
I do, he always keeps it. You doubt that?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“When you know him as well as I, you will
believe it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I flatter myself that I know him better;
and, judging from the past, should call him
both fickle and, in some things, false, even to
you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Up sprung the color to Gladys’s cheek, and
her eyes shone with sudden fire, but her voice
was low and quiet, as she answered quickly,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“One is apt to look for what one wishes to
find: <em>I</em> seek fidelity and truth, and I shall not be
disappointed. Felix may wander, but he will
come back to me: I have learned how to hold
him <em>now</em>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then you are wiser than I. Pray impart the
secret;” and, putting down his cup, Helwyze regarded
her intently, for he saw that the spirit
of the woman was roused to defend her wifely
rights.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nay, I owe it to you; and, since it has prevailed
against your enchantress, I should thank
you for it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The delicate emphasis on the words, “your
enchantress,” enlightened him to the fact that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>Gladys divined, in part at least, the cause of
Olivia’s return. He did not deny, but simply
answered, with a curious contrast between the
carelessness of the first half of his reply, with the
vivid interest of the latter,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Olivia has atoned for her sins handsomely.
But what do you owe <em>me</em>? I have taught you
nothing. I dare not try.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I did not know my own power till you showed
it to me; unintentionally, I believe, and unconsciously,
I used it to such purpose that Felix felt
pride in the wife whom he had thought a child
before. I mean the night I sang and acted
yonder, and did both well, thanks to you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I comprehend, and hope to be forgiven, since
I gave you help or pleasure,” he answered, with
no sign of either confusion or regret, though the
thought shot through his mind, “Can she remember
what came after?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Questionable help, and painful pleasure, yet
it was a memorable hour and a useful one; so
I pardon you, since after the troubled delusion
comes a happy reality.”</p>

<p class='c006'>There was a double meaning in her words,
and a double reproach in the glance which went
from the spot where she had played her part, to
the garland still about her neck.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>“Your yoke is a light one, and you wear it
gracefully. Long may it be so.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Helwyze thought to slip away thus from the
subject; for those accusing eyes were hard to
meet. But Gladys seemed moved to speak with
more than her usual candor, as if anxious to
leave no doubts behind her; and, sitting in the
self-same place, uttered words which moved him
even more than those which she had whispered
in her tormented sleep.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, my yoke is not light;” she said, in that
grave, sweet voice of hers, looking down at the
mystic purple blossom on her breast, with the
symbols of a divine passion at its heart. “I
put it on too ignorantly, too confidingly, and at
times the duties, the responsibilities, which
I assumed with it weigh heavily. I am just
learning how beautiful they are, how sacred they
should be, and trying to prove worthy of them.
I know that Felix did not love as I loved, when
he married me,—from pity, I believe. No one
told me this: I felt, I guessed it, and would
have given him back his liberty, if, after patient
trial, I had found that I could not make him
happy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Can you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, thank God! not only happy, but good;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>and henceforth duty is delight, for I can teach
him to love as I love, and he is glad to learn
of me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Months before, when the girl Gladys had
betrayed her maiden tenderness, she had glowed
like the dawn, and found no language but her
blushes; now the woman sat there steadfast
and passion-pale, owning her love with the
eloquence of fervent speech; both pleading
and commanding, in the name of wifehood and
motherhood, for the right to claim the man she
had won at such cost.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And if you fail?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I shall not fail, unless you come between us.
I have won Olivia’s promise not to tempt Felix’s
errant fancy with her beauty. Can I not win
yours to abstain from troubling his soul with
still more harmful trials? It is to ask this that
I speak now, and I believe I shall not speak in
vain.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Helwyze bent and looked into her face as he
uttered that one word below his breath. He
dared do no more; for there was that about her,
perilously frank and lovely though she was,
which held in check his lawless spirit, and made
it reverence, even while it rebelled against her
power over him.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>She neither shrank nor turned aside, but
studied earnestly that unmoved countenance
which hid a world of wild emotion so successfully,
that even her eyes saw no token of it,
except the deepening line between the brows.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Because I am bold enough to think I know
you better even than Olivia does; that you are
not cold and cruel, and, having given me the
right to live for Felix, you will not disturb our
peace; that, if I look into your soul, as I looked
into my husband’s, I shall find there what I seek,—justice
as well as generosity.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You shall!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I knew you would not disappoint me. For
this promise I am more grateful than words can
express, since it takes away all fear for Felix,
and shows me that I was right in appealing to
the heart which you try to kill. Ah! be your
best self always, and so make life a blessing, not
the curse you often call it,” she added, giving
him a smile like sunshine, a cordial glance which
was more than he could bear.</p>

<p class='c006'>“With you I am. Stay, and show me how
to do it,” he began, stretching both hands towards
her with an almost desperate urgency in
voice and gesture.</p>

<p class='c006'>But Gladys neither saw nor heard; for at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>that moment Felix came through the hall singing
one of the few perfect love songs in the
world,—</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c000'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Che farò senza</span> Eurydice.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“See, he does keep his promise to me: I
knew he would come back!” she cried delightedly,
and hurried to meet him, leaving Helwyze
nothing but the passion-flowers to fill his empty
hands.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>XV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>“Back again, earlier than before. But not
to stay long, thank Heaven! By another
month we will be truly at home, my Gladys,”
whispered Canaris, as they went up the steps, in
the mellow September sunshine.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I hope so!” she answered, fervently, and
paused an instant before entering the door; for,
coming from the light and warmth without, it
seemed as dark and chilly as the entrance to a
tomb.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are tired, love? Come and rest before
you see a soul.”</p>

<p class='c006'>With a new sort of tenderness, Canaris led her
up to her own little bower, and lingered there to
arrange the basket of fresh recruits she had
brought for her winter garden: while Gladys
lay contentedly on the couch where he placed
her, looking about the room as if greeting old
friends; but her eyes always came back to him,
full of a reposeful happiness which proved that all
was well with her.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>“There! now the little fellows sit right comfortably
in the moss, and will soon feel at home.
I’ll go find Mother Bland, and see what his
Serene Highness is about,” said the young man,
rising from his work, warm and gay, but in no
haste to go, as he had been before.</p>

<p class='c006'>Gladys remembered that; and when, at last,
he left her, she shut her eyes to re-live, in
thought, the three blissful months she had spent
in teaching him to love her with the love in
which self bears no part. Before the happy
reverie was half over, the old lady arrived; and,
by the time the young one was ready, Canaris
came to fetch her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“My dearest, I am afraid we must give up our
plan,” he said, softly, as he led her away: “Helwyze
is so changed, I come to tell you, lest it
should shock you when you see him. I think it
would be cruel to go at once. Can you wait a
little longer?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“If we ought. How is he changed?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just worn away, as a rock is by the beating
of the sea, till there seems little left of him except
the big eyes and greater sharpness of both
tongue and temper. Say nothing about it, and
seem not to notice it; else he will freeze you
with a look, as he did me when I exclaimed.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>“Poor man! we will be very patient, very kind;
for it must be awful to think of dying with no
light beyond,” sighed Gladys, touching the cross
at her white throat.</p>

<p class='c006'>“A Dante without a Beatrice: I am happier
than he;” and Canaris laid his cheek against
hers with the gesture of a boy, the look of a man
who has found the solace which is also his salvation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Helwyze received them quietly, a little coldly,
even; and Gladys reproached herself with too
long neglect of what she had assumed as a duty,
when she saw how ill he looked, for <em>his</em> summer
had not been a blissful one. He had spent it in
wishing for her, and in persuading himself that
the desire was permissible, since he asked nothing
but what she had already given him,—her
presence and her friendship. It was her intellect
he loved and wanted, not her heart; that
she might give her husband wholly, since he understood
and cared for affection only: her mind,
with all its lovely possibilities, Helwyze coveted,
and reasoned himself into the belief that he had
a right to enjoy it, conscious all the while that
his purpose was a delusion and a snare. Olivia
had mourned over the moody taciturnity which
made a lonely cranny of the cliffs his favorite resort,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>where he sat, day after day, watching, with an
irresistible fascination, the ever-changing sea,—beautiful
and bitter as the hidden tide of thought
and feeling in his own breast, where lay the
image of Gladys, as placid, yet as powerful, as the
moon which ruled the ebb and flow of that vaster
ocean. Being a fatalist for want of a higher
faith, he left all to chance, and came home
simply resolved to enjoy what was left him as long
and as unobtrusively as possible; since Felix
owed him much, and Gladys need never know
what she had prayed <em>not</em> to know.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sitting at the table, as they sat almost a
year ago, he watched the two young faces as he
had done then, finding each, unlike his own,
changed for the better. Gladys was a girl no
longer; and the new womanliness which had
come to her was of the highest type, for inward
beauty lent its imperishable loveliness to features
faulty in themselves, and character gave its indescribable
charm to the simplest manners.
Helwyze saw all this; and perceiving also how
much heart had already quickened intellect, began
to long for both, and to grudge his pupil to her
new master.</p>

<p class='c006'>Canaris seemed to have lost something of his
boyish comeliness, and had taken on a manlier air
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>of strength and stability, most becoming, and
evidently a source of pardonable pride to him.
At his age even three months could work a serious
alteration in one so easily affected by all
influences; and Helwyze felt a pang of envy as
he saw the broad shoulders and vigorous limbs,
the wholesome color in the cheeks, and best of
all, the serene content of a happy heart.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What have you been doing to yourself,
Felix? Have you discovered the Elixir of Life
up there? If so, impart the secret, and let me
have a sip,” he said, as Canaris pushed away
his plate after satisfying a hearty appetite with
the relish of a rustic.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Gladys did,” he answered, with a nod across
the table, which said much. “She would not let
me idle about while waiting for ideas: she just
set me to work. I dug acres, it seemed to me,
and amazed the gardener with my exploits.
Liked it, too; for she was overseer, and would
not let me off till I had done my task and
earned my wages. A wonderfully pleasant life,
and I am the better for it, in spite of my sunburn
and blisters;” and Canaris stretched out a
pair of sinewy brown hands with an air of satisfaction
which made Gladys laugh so blithely it
was evident that their summer had been full of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>the innocent jollity of youth, fine weather, and
congenial pastime.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Adam and Eve in Eden, with all the modern
improvements. Not even a tree of knowledge or
a serpent to disturb you!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, yes, we had them both; but we only ate
the good fruit, and the snake did not tempt me!”
cried Gladys, anxious to defend her Paradise
even from playful mockery.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He did me. I longed to kill him, but my
Eve owed him no grudge, and would not permit
me to do it; so the old enemy sunned himself in
peace, and went into winter quarters a reformed
reptile, I am sure.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Canaris did not look up as he spoke, but
Helwyze asked hastily,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“I hope you harvested a few fresh ideas for
winter work? We ought to have something to
show after so laborious a summer.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have: I am going to write a novel or a
play. I cannot decide which; but rather lean
toward the latter, and, being particularly happy,
feel inclined to write a tragedy;” and something
beside the daring of an ambitious author
sparkled in the eyes Canaris fixed upon his
patron. It looked too much like the expression
of a bondman about to become a freeman to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>suit Helwyze; but he replied, as imperturbably
as ever,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Try the tragedy, by all means: the novel
would be beyond you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, if you please?” demanded Canaris,
loftily.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Because you have neither patience nor experience
enough to do it well. Goethe says:
‘In the novel it is <em>sentiments</em> and <em>events</em> that
are exhibited; in the drama it is <em>characters</em> and
<em>deeds</em>. The novel goes slowly forward, the drama
must hasten. In the novel, some degree of scope
may be allowed to chance; but it must be led
and guided by the sentiments of the personages.
Fate, on the other hand, which, by means of outward,
unconnected circumstances, carries forward
men, without their own concurrence, to an
unforeseen catastrophe, can only have place in
the drama. Chance may produce pathetic situations,
but not tragic ones.’”</p>

<p class='c006'>Helwyze paused there abruptly; for the memory
which served him so well outran his tongue,
and recalled the closing sentence of the quotation,—words
which he had no mind to utter
then and there,—“Fate ought always to be
terrible; and it is in the highest sense tragic,
when it brings into a ruinous concatenation the
guilty man and the guiltless with him.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>“Then you think I <em>could</em> write a play?” asked
Canaris, with affected carelessness.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think you could act one, better than imagine
or write it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What, I?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, you; because you are dramatic by nature,
and it is easier for you to express yourself
in gesture and tone, than by written or spoken
language. You were born for an actor, are
fitted for it in every way, and I advise you to try
it. It would pay better than poetry; and that
stream <em>may</em> run dry.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Gladys looked indignant at what she thought
bad advice and distasteful pleasantry; but Canaris
seemed struck and charmed with the new
idea, protesting that he would first write, then
act, his play, and prove himself a universal
genius.</p>

<p class='c006'>No more was said just then; but long afterward
the conversation came back to him like an
inspiration, and was the seed of a purpose which,
through patient effort, bore fruit in a brilliant
and successful career: for Canaris, like many
another man, did not know his own strength or
weakness yet, neither the true gift nor the
power of evil which lay unsuspected within
him.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>So the old life began again, at least in outward
seeming; but it was impossible for it to
last long. The air was too full of the electricity
of suppressed and conflicting emotions to be
wholesome; former relations could not be resumed,
because sincerity had gone out of them;
and the quiet, which reigned for a time, was
only the lull before the storm.</p>

<p class='c006'>Gladys soon felt this, but tried to think it was
owing to the contrast between the free, happy
days she had enjoyed so much, and uttered no
complaint; for Felix was busy with his play,
sanguine as ever, inspired now by a nobler ambition
than before, and happy in his work.</p>

<p class='c006'>Helwyze had flattered himself that he could
be content with the harmless shadow, since he
could not possess the sweet substance of a love
whose seeming purity was its most delusive danger.
But he soon discovered “how bitter a thing
it is to look into happiness through another man’s
eyes;” and, even while he made no effort to rob
Canaris of his treasure, he hated him for possessing
it, finding the hatred all the more poignant,
because it was his own hand which had forced
Felix to seize and secure it. He had thought
to hold and hide this new secret; but it held
him, and would not be hidden, for it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>stronger than even his strong will, and ruled
him with a power which at times filled him with
a sort of terror. Having allowed it to grow, and
taken it to his bosom, he could not cast it out
again, and it became a torment, not the comfort
he had hoped to find it. His daily affliction
was to see how much the young pair were to
each other, to read in their faces a hundred
happy hopes and confidences in which he had
no part, and to remember the confession wrung
from the lips dearest to him, that his death
would bring to them their much-desired freedom.</p>

<p class='c006'>At times he was minded to say “Go,” but the
thought of the utter blank her absence would
leave behind daunted him. Often an almost
uncontrollable desire to tell her that which
would mar her trust in her husband tempted
him; for, having yielded to a greater temptation,
all lesser ones seemed innocent beside it; and,
worse than all, the old morbid longing for some
excitement, painful even, if it could not be
pleasurable, goaded him to the utterance of half
truths, which irritated Canaris and perplexed
Gladys, till she could no longer doubt the cause
of this strange mood. It seemed as if her
innocent hand gave the touch which set the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>avalanche slipping swiftly but silently to its
destructive fall.</p>

<p class='c006'>One day when Helwyze was pacing to and fro
in the library, driven by the inward storm which
no outward sign betrayed, except his excessive
pallor and unusual restlessness, she looked up
from her book, asking compassionately,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Are you suffering, sir?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Torment.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Can I do nothing?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nothing!”</p>

<p class='c006'>She went on reading, as if glad to be left in
peace; for distrust, as well as pity, looked out
from her frank eyes, and there was no longer
any pleasure in the duties she performed for
Canaris’s sake.</p>

<p class='c006'>But Helwyze, jealous even of the book which
seemed to absorb her, soon paused again, to ask,
in a calmer tone,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“What interests you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘The Scarlet Letter.’”</p>

<p class='c006'>The hands loosely clasped behind him were
locked more closely by an involuntary gesture,
as if the words made him wince; otherwise unmoved,
he asked again, with the curiosity he
often showed about her opinions of all she
read,—</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>“What do you think of Hester?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I admire her courage; for she repented, and
did not hide her sin with a lie.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then you must despise Dimmesdale?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I ought, perhaps; but I cannot help pitying
his weakness, while I detest his deceit: he
loved so much.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“So did Roger;” and Helwyze drew nearer,
with the peculiar flicker in his eyes, as of a
light kindled suddenly behind a carefully drawn
curtain.</p>

<p class='c006'>“At first; then his love turned to hate, and
he committed the unpardonable sin,” answered
Gladys, much moved by that weird and wonderful
picture of guilt and its atonement.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The unpardonable sin!” echoed Helwyze,
struck by her words and manner.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hawthorne somewhere describes it as ‘the
want of love and reverence for the human soul,
which makes a man pry into its mysterious depths,
not with a hope or purpose of making it better,
but from a cold, philosophical curiosity. This
would be the separation of the intellect from the
heart: and this, perhaps, would be as unpardonable
a sin as to doubt God, whom we cannot
harm; for in doing this we must inevitably do
great wrong both to ourselves and others.’”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>As she spoke, fast and earnestly, Gladys felt
herself upon the brink of a much-desired, but
much-dreaded, explanation; for Canaris, while
owning to her that there <em>was</em> a secret, would not
tell it till Helwyze freed him from his promise.
She thought that he delayed to ask this absolution
till she was fitter to bear the truth, whatever it
might be; and she had resolved to spare her
husband the pain of an avowal, by demanding it
herself of Helwyze. The moment seemed to
have come, and both knew it; for he regarded
her with the quick, piercing look which read her
purpose before she could put it into words.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are right; yet Roger was the wronged
one, and the others deserved to suffer.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“They did; but Hester’s suffering ennobled
her, because nobly borne; Dimmesdale’s destroyed
him, because he paltered weakly with his
conscience. Roger let his wrong turn him from
a man into a devil, and deserves the contempt
and horror he rouses in us. The keeping of the
secret makes the romance; the confession of it is
the moral, showing how falsehood can ruin a
life, and truth only save it at the last.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Never have a secret, Gladys: they are hard
masters, whom we hate, yet dare not rebel
against.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>His accent of sad sincerity seemed to clear the
way for her, and she spoke out, briefly and
bravely,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sir, <em>you</em> dare any thing! Tell me what it is
which makes Felix obey you against his will.
He owns it, but will not speak till you consent.
Tell me, I beseech you!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Could you bear it?” he asked, admiring her
courage, yet doubtful of the wisdom of purchasing
a moment’s satisfaction at such a cost; for,
though he could cast down her idol, he dared not
set up another in its place.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Try me!” she cried: “nothing can lessen my
love, and doubt afflicts me more than the hardest
truth.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I fear not: with you love and respect go
hand in hand, and some sins you would find very
hard to pardon.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Involuntarily Gladys shrunk a little, and her
eye questioned his inscrutable face, as she answered
slowly, thinking only of her husband,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Something very mean and false <em>would</em> be
hard to forgive; but not some youthful fault,
some shame borne for others, or even a crime, if
a very human emotion, a generous but mistaken
motive, led to it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then this secret is better left untold; for it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>would try you sorely to know that Felix <em>had</em>
been guilty of the fault you find harder to forgive
than a crime,—deceit. Wait a little, till you are
accustomed to the thought, then you shall have
the facts; and pity, even while you must despise,
him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>While he spoke, Gladys sat like one nerving
herself to receive a blow; but at the last words
she suddenly put up her hand as if to arrest it,
saying, hurriedly,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“No! do not tell me; I cannot bear it yet, nor
from you. He shall tell me; it will be easier
so, and less like treachery. O sir,” she added,
in a passionately pleading tone, “use mercifully
whatever bitter knowledge you possess!
Remember how young he is, how neglected as
a boy, how tempted he may have been; and
deal generously, honorably with him,—and with
me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Her voice broke there. She spread her hands
before her eyes, and fled out of the room, as if in
his face she read a more disastrous confession
than any Felix could ever make. Helwyze stood
motionless, looking as he looked the night she
spoke more frankly but less forcibly: and when
she vanished, he stole away to his own room, as
he stole then; only now his usually colorless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>cheek burned with a fiery flush, and his hand
went involuntarily to his breast, as if, like Dimmesdale,
he carried an invisible scarlet letter
branded there.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>XVI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>Neither had heard the door of that inner
room open quietly; neither had seen Canaris
stand upon the threshold for an instant, then
draw back, looking as if he had found another
skeleton to hide in the cell where he was laboring
at the third act of the tragedy which he was to
live, not write.</p>

<p class='c006'>He had heard the last words Gladys said, he
had seen the last look Helwyze wore, and, like a
flash of lightning, the truth struck and stunned
him. At first he sat staring aghast at the thing
he plainly saw, yet hardly comprehended. Then
a sort of fury seized and shook him, as he sprang
up with hands clenched, eyes ablaze, looking as
if about to instantly avenge the deadliest injury
one man could do another. But the half savage
self-control adversity had taught stood him in
good stead now, curbing the first natural but
reckless wrath which nerved every fibre of his
strong young body with an almost irresistible
impulse to kill Helwyze without a word.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>The gust of blind passion subsided quickly
into a calmer, but not less dangerous, mood; and,
fearing to trust himself so near his enemy,
Canaris rushed away, to walk fast and far, unconscious
where he went, till the autumnal
gloaming brought him back, master of himself,
he thought.</p>

<p class='c006'>While he wandered aimlessly about the city,
he had been recalling the past with the vivid
skill which at such intense moments seems to
bring back half-forgotten words, apparently unnoticed
actions, and unconscious impressions;
as fire causes invisible letters to stand out upon
a page where they are traced in sympathetic
ink.</p>

<p class='c006'>Not a doubt of Gladys disturbed the ever-deepening
current of a love the more precious
for its newness, the more powerful for its ennobling
influence. But every instinct of his
nature rose in revolt against Helwyze, all the
more rebellious and resentful for the long subjection
in which he had been held.</p>

<p class='c006'>A master stronger than the ambition which
had been the ruling passion of his life so far
asserted its supremacy now, and made it possible
for him to pay the price of liberty without further
weak delay or unmanly regret.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>This he resolved upon, and this he believed
he could accomplish safely and soon. But if
Helwyze, with far greater skill and self-control,
had failed to guide or subdue the conflicting
passions let loose among them, how could Canaris
hope to do it, or retard by so much as
one minute the irresistible consequences of their
acts? “The providence of God cannot be hurried,”
and His retribution falls at the appointed
time, saving, even when it seems to destroy.</p>

<p class='c006'>Returning resolute but weary, Canaris was
relieved to find that a still longer reprieve was
granted him; for Olivia was there, and Gladys
apparently absorbed in the tender toil women
love, making ready for the Christmas gift she
hoped to give him. Helwyze sent word that he
was suffering one of his bad attacks, and bade
them all good-night; so there was nothing to
mar the last quiet evening these three were ever
to pass together.</p>

<p class='c006'>When Canaris had seen Olivia to the winter
quarters she inhabited near by, he went up to
his own room, where Gladys lay, looking like a
child who had cried itself to sleep. The sight
of the pathetic patience touched with slumber’s
peace, in the tear-stained face upon the pillow,
wrung his heart, and, stooping, he softly kissed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>the hand upon the coverlet,—the small hand
that wore a wedding-ring, now grown too large
for it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“God bless my dearest!” he whispered, with a
sob in his throat. “Out of this accursed house
she shall go to-morrow, though I leave all but
love and liberty behind me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Sleepless, impatient, and harassed by thoughts
that would not let him rest, he yielded to the uncanny
attraction which the library now had for
him, and went down again, deluding himself
with the idea that he could utilize emotion and
work for an hour or two.</p>

<p class='c006'>The familiar room looked strange to him; and
when the door of Helwyze’s apartment opened
quietly, he started, although it was only Stern,
coming to nap before the comfortable fire.
Something in Canaris’s expectant air and attitude
made the man answer the question his
face seemed to ask.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Quiet at last, sir. He has had no sleep for
many nights, and is fairly worn out.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You look so, too. Go and rest a little. I
shall be here writing for several hours, and can
see to him,” said Canaris, kindly, as the poor old
fellow respectfully tried to swallow a portentous
gape behind his hand.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>“Thank you, Mr. Felix: it would be a comfort
just to lose myself. Master is not likely to want
any thing; but, if he should call, just step and
give him his drops, please. They are all ready.
I fixed them myself: he is so careless when he
is half-asleep, and, not being used to this new
stuff, an overdose might kill him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Giving these directions, Stern departed with
alacrity, and left Canaris to his watch. He had
often done as much before, but never with such
a sense of satisfaction as now; and though he
carefully abstained from giving himself a reason
for the act, no sooner had the valet gone than
he went to look in upon Helwyze, longing to
call out commandingly, “Wake, and hear me!”</p>

<p class='c006'>But the helplessness of the man disarmed
him, the peaceful expression of the sharp, white
features mutely reproached him, the recollection
of what he would awaken to made Canaris
ashamed to exult over a defeated enemy; and
he turned away, with an almost compassionate
glance at the straight, still figure, clearly defined
against the dusky background of the darkened
room.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He looks as if he were dead.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Canaris did not speak aloud, but it seemed as
if a voice echoed the words with a suggestive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>emphasis, that made him pause as he approached
the study-table, conscious of a quick thrill of
comprehension tingling through him like an
answer. Why he covered both ears with a sudden
gesture, he could not tell, nor why he hastily
seated himself, caught up the first book at hand
and began to read without knowing what he
read. Only for an instant, however, then the
words grew clear before him, and his eyes rested
on this line,—</p>

<p class='c006'>He dropped the book, as if it had burnt him,
and looked over his shoulder, almost expecting
to see the dark thought lurking in his mind
take shape before him. Empty, dim, and quiet
was the lofty room; but a troubled spirit and
distempered imagination peopled it with such
vivid and tormenting phantoms of the past, the
present and the future, that he scarcely knew
whether he was awake or dreaming, as he sat
there alone, waiting for midnight, and the spectre
of an uncommitted deed.</p>

<p class='c006'>His wandering eye fell on a leaf of paper,
lying half-shrivelled by the heat of the red fire.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>This recalled the hour when, in the act of burning
that first manuscript, Helwyze had saved
him, and all that followed shortly after.</p>

<p class='c006'>Not a pleasant memory, it seemed; for his face
darkened, and his glance turned to a purple-covered
volume, left on the low chair where
Gladys usually sat, and often read in that beloved
book. A still more bitter recollection
bowed his head at sight of it, till some newer,
sharper thought seemed to pierce him with a
sudden stab, and he laid his clenched hand on
the pile of papers before him, as if taking an
oath more binding than the one made there
nearly three years ago.</p>

<p class='c006'>He had been reading Shakespeare lately, for
one may copy the great masters; and now, as he
tried with feverish energy to work upon his play,
the grim or gracious models he had been studying
seemed to rise and live before him. But
one and all were made subject to the strong
passions which ruled him; jealousy, ambition,
revenge, and love wore their appropriate guise,
acted their appropriate parts, and made him one
with them. Othello would only show himself
as stabbing the perfidious Iago; Macbeth always
grasped at the air-drawn dagger; Hamlet was
continually completing his fateful task; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>Romeo whispered, with the little vial at his
lips,—</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c000'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>“Oh, true apothecary!</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy drugs are quick.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Canaris tried to chase away these troubled
spirits; but they would not down, and, yielding
to them, he let his mind wander as it would, till
he had “supped full of horrors,” feeling as if in
the grasp of a nightmare which led him, conscious,
but powerless, toward some catastrophe
forefelt, rather than foreseen. How long this
lasted he never knew; for nothing broke the
silence growing momently more terrible as he
listened to the stealthy tread of the temptation
coming nearer and nearer, till it appeared in the
likeness of himself, while a voice said, in the
ordinary tone which so often makes dreams
grotesque at their most painful climax,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Master is so careless when half-asleep; and,
not being used to this new stuff, an overdose
might kill him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>As if these words were the summons for which
he had been waiting, Canaris rose up suddenly
and went into that other room, too entirely absorbed
by the hurrying emotions which swept
him away to see what looked like a new phantom
coming in. It might have been the shade of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>young Juliet, gentle Desdemona, poor Ophelia,
or, better still the <i>eidolen</i> of Margaret wandering,
pale and pensive, through the baleful darkness
of this <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Walpurgis Nacht</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c006'>He did not see it; he saw nothing but the
glass upon the table where the dim light burned,
the little vial with its colorless contents, and
Helwyze stirring in his bed, as if about to wake
and speak. Conscious only of the purpose
which now wholly dominated him, Canaris,
without either haste or hesitation, took the
bottle, uncorked, and held it over the glass
half-filled with water. But before a single drop
could fall a cold hand touched his own, and,
with a start that crushed the vial in his grasp,
he found himself eye to eye with Gladys.</p>

<p class='c006'>Guilt was frozen upon his face, terror upon
hers; but neither spoke, for a third voice muttered
drowsily, “Stern, give me more; don’t
rouse me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Canaris could not stir; Gladys whispered, with
white lips, and her hand upon the cup,—“Dare
I give it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>He could only answer by a sign, and cowered
into the shadow, while she put the draught to
Helwyze’s lips, fearing to let him waken now.
He drank drowsily, yet seemed half-conscious of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>her presence; for he looked up with sleep-drunken
eyes, and murmured, as if to the familiar
figure of a dream,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mine asleep, his awake,” then whispering
brokenly about “Felix, Vivien, and daring any
thing,” he was gone again into the lethargy
which alone could bring forgetfulness.</p>

<p class='c006'>Gladys feared her husband would hear the
almost inaudible words; but he had vanished,
and when she glided out to join him, carefully
closing the door behind her, a glance showed
that her fear was true.</p>

<p class='c006'>Relieved, yet not repentant, he stood there
looking at a red stain on his hand with such a
desperate expression that Gladys could only cling
to him, saying, in a terror-stricken whisper,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Felix, for God’s sake, come away! What are
you doing here?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Going mad, I think,” he answered, under his
breath; but added, lifting up his hand with an
ominous gesture, “I would have done it if you
had not stopped me. It would be better for us
all if he were dead.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not so; thank Heaven I came in time to
save you from the sin of murder!” she said,
holding fast the hand as yet unstained by any
blood but its own.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>“I <em>have</em> committed murder in my heart. Why
not profit by the sin, since it is there? I hate
that man! I have cause, and you know it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, no, not all! You shall tell me every
thing; but not now, not here.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The time has come, and this is the place to
tell it. Sit there and listen. I must untie or
cut the snarl to-night.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He pointed to the great chair; and, grateful
for any thing that could change or stem the
dangerous current of his thoughts, Gladys sank
down, feeling as if, after this shock, she was prepared
for any discovery or disaster. Canaris
stood before her, white and stern, as if he were
both judge and culprit; for a sombre wrath still
burned in his eye, and his face worked with the
mingled shame and contempt warring within
him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I heard and saw this afternoon, when you two
talked together yonder, and I knew then what
made you so glad to go away, so loath to come
back. <em>You</em> have had a secret as well as I.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I was never sure until to-day. Do not speak
of that: it is enough to know it, and forget it if
we can. Tell your secret: it has burdened you
so long, you will be glad to end it. <em>He</em> would
have done so, but I would not let him.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>“I thought it would be hard to tell you, yet
now my fault looks so small and innocent beside
his, I can confess without much shame or fear.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But it was not easy; for he had gone so far
into a deeper, darker world that night, it was difficult
to come to lesser sins and lighter thoughts.
As he hesitated for a word, his eye fell upon the
purple-covered book, and he saw a way to shorten
his confession. Catching up a pen, he bent
over the volume an instant, then handed it to
Gladys, open at the title-page. She knew it,—the
dear romance, worn with much reading,—and
looked wonderingly at the black mark drawn
through the name, “Felix Canaris,” and the
words, “Jasper Helwyze,” written boldly below.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What does it mean?” she asked, refusing
to believe the discovery which the expression of
his averted face confirmed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That I am a living lie. He wrote that book.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Every line.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But not the other?” she said; clinging to a
last hope, as every thing seemed falling about
her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“All, except half a dozen of the songs.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Down dropped the book between them,—now
a thing of little worth,—and, trying to conceal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>from him the contempt which even love could
not repress, Gladys hid her face, with one reproach,
the bitterest she could have uttered,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“O my husband! did you give up honor,
liberty, and peace for so poor a thing as that?”</p>

<p class='c006'>It cut him to the soul: for now he saw how
high a price he had paid for an empty name;
how mean and poor his ambition looked; how
truly he deserved to be despised for that of which
he had striven to be proud. Gladys had so rejoiced
over him as a poet, that it was the hardest task
of all to put off his borrowed singing-robes, and
show himself an ordinary man. He forgot that
there was any other tribunal than this, as he
stood waiting for his sentence, oppressed with
the fear that out of her almost stern sense of
honor she might condemn him to the loss of the
respect and confidence which he had lately
learned to value as much as happiness and love.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You must despise me; but if you knew”—he
humbly began, unable to bear the silence
longer.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Tell me, then. I will not judge until I
know;” and Gladys, just, even in her sorrow,
looked up with an expression which said plainer
than words, “For better, for worse; this is the
worse, but I love you still.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>That made it possible for him to go on, fast
and low, not stopping to choose phrases, but
pouring out the little story of his temptation and
fall, with a sense of intense relief that he was
done with slavery for ever.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Neither of us coolly planned this thing; it
came about so simply and naturally, it seemed a
mere accident.—And yet, who can tell what <em>he</em>
might have planned, seeing how weak I was, how
ready to be tempted.—It happened in that second
month, when I promised to stay; he to help me
with my book. It was <em>all</em> mine then; but when
we came to look at it, there was not enough to
fill even the most modest volume; for I had
burnt many, and must recall them, or write more.
I tried honestly, but the power was not in me,
and I fell into despair again; for the desire to
be known was the breath of my life.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You will be, if not in this way, in some
other; for power of some sort <em>is</em> in you. Believe
it, and wait for it to show itself,” said Gladys,
anxious to add patience and courage to the new
humility and sincerity, which could not fail to
ennoble and strengthen him in time.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Bless you for that!” he answered, gratefully,
and hurried on. “It came about in this wise:
one day my master—he was then, but is no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>longer, thank God!—sat reading over a mass
of old papers, before destroying them. Here he
came upon verses written in the diaries kept
years ago, and threw them to me, ‘to laugh
over,’ as he said. I did not laugh: I was filled
with envy and admiration, and begged him to
publish them. He scorned the idea, and bade
me put them in the fire. I begged to keep
them, and then,—Gladys, I swear to you I cannot
tell whether I read the project in his face,
or whether my own evil genius put it into my
head,—then I said, audaciously, though hardly
dreaming he would consent, ‘You do not care
for fame, and throw these away as worthless:
I long for it, and see more power in these than
in any I can hope to write for years, perhaps;
let me add them to mine, and see what will come
of it.’ ‘Put your own name to them, if you do,
and take the consequences,’ he answered, in that
brusque way of his, which seems so careless, yet
is so often premeditated. I assented, as I would
have done to any thing that promised a quick
trial of my talent; for in my secret soul I
thought some of my songs better than his metaphysical
verses, which impressed, rather than
charmed me. The small imposture seemed to
amuse him; I had few scruples then, and we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>did it, with much private jesting about Beaumont
and Fletcher, literary frauds, and borrowed
plumage. You know the rest. The book succeeded,
but he saved it; and the critics left me
small consolation, for my songs were ignored as
youthful ditties, his poems won all the praise,
and <em>I</em> was pronounced a second Shelley.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But he? Did he claim no share of the glory?
Was he content to let you have it all?” questioned
Gladys, trying to understand a thing so
foreign to her nature that it seemed incredible.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes; I offered to come down from my high
place, as soon as I realized how little right I
had to it. But he forbade me, saying, what I was
fool enough to believe, that my talent only
needed time and culture, and the sunshine of
success to ripen it; that notoriety would be a
burden to him, since he had neither health to
sustain nor spirits to enjoy it; that in me he
would live his youth over again, and, in return
for such help as he could give, I should be a
son to him. That touched and won me; now
I can see in it a trap to catch and hold me, that
he might amuse himself with my folly, play the
generous patron, and twist my life to suit his
ends. He likes curious and costly toys; he had
one then, and has not paid for it yet.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>“This other book? Tell me of that, and
speak low, or he may hear us,” whispered
Gladys, trembling lest fire and powder should
meet.</p>

<p class='c006'>With a motion of his foot Canaris sent the
book that lay between them spinning across the
hearth-rug out of sight, and answered, with a
short, exultant laugh,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah! there the fowler was taken in his own
snare. I did not see it then, and found it hard
to understand why he should exert himself to
please you by helping me. I thought it was a
mere freak of literary rivalry; and, when I taxed
him with it, he owned that, though he cared
nothing for the world’s praise, it <em>was</em> pleasant
to know that his powers were still unimpaired,
and be able to laugh in his sleeve at the deluded
critics. That was like him, and it deceived me
till to-day. Now I know that he begrudged me
your admiration, wanted your tears and smiles
for himself, and did not hesitate to steal them.
The night he so adroitly read <em>his</em> work for mine,
he tempted me through you. I had resolved to
deserve the love and honor you gave me; and
again I tried, and again I failed, for my romance
was a poor, pale thing to his. He had read it;
and, taking the same plot, made it what you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>know, writing as only such a man could write,
when a strong motive stimulated him to do his
best.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But why did you submit? Why stand
silent and let him do so false a thing?” cried
poor Gladys, wondering when the end of the
tangle would come.</p>

<p class='c006'>“At first his coolness staggered me; then I
was curious to hear, then held even, against my
will, by admiration of the thing—and you. I
meant to speak out, I longed to do it; but it
was very hard, while you were praising me so eloquently.
The words were on my lips, when in
his face I saw a look that sealed them. He
meant that I should utter the self-accusation
which would lower me for ever and raise him
in your regard. I could not bear it. There was
no time to think, only to feel, and I vowed to
make you happy, at all costs. I hardly thought
he would submit; but he did, and I believed that
it was through surprise at being outwitted for
the moment, or pity towards you. It was neither:
he fancied I had discovered his secret, and he
<em>dared</em> not defy me then.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But when I was gone? You were so late
that night: I heard your voices, sharp and angry,
as I went away.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>“Yes; that was <em>my</em> hour, and I enjoyed it.
He had often twitted me with the hold he had
on my name and fame, and I bore it; for, till
I loved you, they were the dearest things I
owned. That night I told him he <em>should not</em>
speak; that you should enjoy your pride in
me, even at his expense, and I refused to
release him from his bond, as he had, more
than once, refused to release me: for we had
sworn never to confess till both agreed to it.
Good heavens! how low he must have thought
I had fallen, if I could consent to buy your happiness
at the cost of my honor! He did think
it: that made him yield; that is the cause of
the contempt he has not cared to hide from me
since then; and that adds a double edge to my
hatred now. I was to be knave as well as fool;
and while I blinded myself with his reflected
light, he would have filched my one jewel from
me. Gladys, save me, keep me, or I shall do
something desperate yet!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Beside himself with humiliation, remorse, and
wrath, Canaris flung himself down before her, as
if only by clinging to that frail spar could he
ride out the storm in which he was lost without
compass or rudder.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then Gladys showed him that such love as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>hers could not fail, but, like an altar-fire, glowed
the stronger for every costly sacrifice thrown
therein. Lifting up the discrowned head, she
laid it on her bosom with a sweet motherliness
which comforted more than her tender words.</p>

<p class='c006'>“My poor Felix! you have suffered enough
for this deceit; I forgive it, and keep my
reproaches for the false friend who led you
astray.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It was so paltry, weak, and selfish. You
<em>must</em> despise me,” he said, wistfully, still thinking
more of his own pain than hers.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do despise the sin, not the dear sinner who
repents and is an honest man again.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But a beggar.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We have each other. Hush! stand up;
some one is coming.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Canaris had barely time to spring to his feet,
when Stern came in, and was about to pass on
in silence, though much amazed to see Gladys
there at that hour, when the expression of the
young man’s face made him forget decorum and
stop short, exclaiming, anxiously,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mr. Felix, what’s the matter? Is master
worse?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Safe and asleep. Mrs. Canaris came to see
what I was about.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>“Then, sir, if I may make so bold, the sooner
she gets to bed again the better. It is far too
late for her to be down here; the poor young
lady looks half-dead,” Stern whispered, with the
freedom of an old servant.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are right. Come, love;” and without
another word Canaris led her away, leaving Stern
to shake his gray head as he looked after them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Gladys <em>was</em> utterly exhausted; and in the hall
she faltered, saying, with a patient sigh, as she
looked up the long stairway, “Dear, wait a little;
it is so far,—my strength is all gone.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Canaris caught her in his arms and carried
her away, asking himself, with a remorseful pang
that rent his heart,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is this the murder I have committed?”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>“Stern!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What time is it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Past two, sir.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What news? I see bad tidings of some sort
in that lugubrious face of yours; out with it!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The little boy arrived at dawn, sir,” answered
old Stern, with a paternal air.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What little boy?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Canaris, Jr., sir,” simpered the valet, venturing
to be jocose.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The deuce he did! Precipitate, like his
father. Where is Felix?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“With her, sir. In a state of mind, as well he
may be, letting that delicate young thing sit up
to keep him company over his poetry stuff,”
muttered Stern, busying himself with the shutters.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sit up! when? where? what are you maundering
about, man?” and Helwyze himself sat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>up among the pillows, looking unusually wide-awake.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Last night, sir, in the study. Mr. Felix
made me go for a wink of sleep, and when I
came back, about one, there sat Mrs. Canaris as
white as her gown, and him looking as wild as a
hawk. Something was amiss, I could see plain
enough, but it wasn’t my place to ask questions;
so I just made bold to suggest that it was late
for her to be up, and he took her away, looking
dazed-like. That’s all I know, sir, till I found
the women in a great flustration this morning.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And I slept through it all?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, sir; so soundly, I was a bit anxious till
you waked. I found the glass empty and the
bottle smashed, and I was afraid you might
have taken too much of that <i>choral</i> while half-asleep.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No fear; nothing kills me. Now get me
up;” and Helwyze made his toilet with a speed
and energy which caused Stern to consider
“<i>choral</i>” a wonderful discovery.</p>

<p class='c006'>A pretence of breakfast; then Helwyze sat
down to wait for further tidings,—externally
quite calm, internally tormented by a great anxiety,
till Olivia came in, full of cheering news
and sanguine expectations.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>“Gladys is asleep, with baby on her arm, and
Felix adoring in the background. Poor boy!
he cannot bear much, and is quite bowed down
with remorse for something he has done. Do
you know what?”</p>

<p class='c006'>As she spoke, Olivia stooped to pick up a
book half-hidden by the fringe of a low chair.
It lay face downward, and, in smoothing the
crumpled leaves before closing it, she caught
sight of a black and blotted name. So did Helwyze;
a look of intelligence flashed over his
face, and, taking the volume quickly, he answered,
with his finger on the title-page,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, now I know, and so may you; for if
one woman is in the secret, it will soon be out.
Felix wrote that, and it is true.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I thought so! One woman <em>has</em> known it for
a long time; nevertheless, the secret was kept
for your sake;” and Olivia’s dark face sparkled
with malicious merriment, as she saw the expression
of mingled annoyance, pride, and pleasure
in his.</p>

<p class='c006'>“My compliments and thanks: you are the
eighth wonder of the world. But what led you
to suspect this little fraud of ours?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I did not, till the last book came; then I
was struck here and there by certain peculiar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>phrases, certain tender epithets, which I think
no one ever heard from your lips but me. These,
in the hero’s mouth, made me sure that you had
helped Canaris, if not done the whole yourself,
and his odd manner at times confirmed my suspicion.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You have a good memory: I forgot that.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have had so few such words from you
that it is easy to remember them,” murmured
Olivia, reproachfully.</p>

<p class='c006'>It seemed to touch him; for just then he
felt deserted, well knowing that he had lost
both Felix and Gladys; but Olivia never would
desert him, no matter what discovery was made,
or who might fall away. He thanked her for
her devotion, with the first ray of hope given for
years, as he said, in the tone so seldom heard,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“You shall have more henceforth; for you
are a staunch friend, and now I have no other.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dear Jasper, you shall never find me wanting.
<em>I</em> will be true to the death!” she cried,
blooming suddenly into her best and brightest
beauty, with the delight of this rare moment.
Then, fearing to express too much, she wisely
turned again to Felix, asking curiously, “But
why did you let this young daw deck himself
out in your plumes? It enrages me, to think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>of his receiving the praise and honor due to
you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He told her briefly, adding, with more than
his accustomed bitterness,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“What did <em>I</em> want with praise and honor?
To be gaped and gossiped about would have
driven me mad. It pleased that vain boy as
much as fooling the public amused me. A whim,
and, being a dishonest one, we shall both have
to pay for it, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What will he do?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He has told Gladys, to begin with; and, if it
had been possible, would have taken some decisive
step to-day. He can do nothing sagely and
quietly: there must be a dramatic <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>dénouement</i></span>
to every chapter of his life. I think he has one
now.” Helwyze laughed, as he struck back the
leaves of the book he still held, and looked at
the dashing signature of his own name.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<em>He</em> wrote that, then?” asked Olivia.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, here, at midnight, while I lay asleep
and let him tell the tale as he liked to Gladys.
No wonder it startled her, so tragically given.
The sequel may be more tragic yet: I seem to
feel it in the air.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What shall <em>you</em> do?” asked Olivia, more
anxiously than before; for Helwyze looked up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>with as sinister an expression as if he knew how
desperate an enemy had stood over him last
night, and when his own turn came, would be
less merciful.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do? Nothing. They will go; I shall stay;
tongues will wag, and I shall be tormented. I
shall seem the gainer, he the loser; but it will
not be so.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Involuntarily his eye went to the little chair
where Gladys would sit no longer, and darkened
as if some light had gone out which used
to cheer and comfort him. Olivia saw it, and
could not restrain the question that broke from
her lips,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“You do love her, Jasper?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I shall miss her; but you shall take her
place.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Calm and a little scornful was his face, his
voice quite steady, and a smile was shed upon
her with the last welcome words. But Olivia
was not deceived: the calmness was unnatural,
the voice <em>too</em> steady, the smile too sudden; and
her heart sank as she thanked him, without
another question. For a while they sat together
playing well their parts, then she went away to
Gladys, and he was left to several hours of solitary
musing.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>Had he been a better man, he would not have
sinned; had he been a worse one, he could not
have suffered; being what he was, he did both,
and, having no one else to study now, looked
deeply into himself, and was dismayed at what
he saw. For the new love, purer, yet more
hopeless than the old, shone like a star above
an abyss, showing him whither he had wandered
in the dark.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sunset came, filling the room with its soft
splendor; and he watched the red rays linger
longest in Gladys’s corner. Her little basket
stood as she left it, her books lay orderly, her
desk was shut, a dead flower drooped from
the slender vase, and across the couch trailed a
soft white shawl she had been wont to wear.
Helwyze did not approach the spot, but stood
afar off looking at these small familiar things
with the melancholy fortitude of one inured to
loss and pain. Regret rather than remorse
possessed him as he thought, drearily,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“A year to-morrow since she came. How
shall I exist without her? Where will her new
home be?”</p>

<p class='c006'>An answer was soon given to the last question;
for, while his fancy still hovered about that
nook, and the gentle presence which had vanished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>as the sunshine was fast vanishing, Canaris
came in wearing such an expression of despair,
that Helwyze recoiled, leaving half-uttered a
playful inquiry about “the little son.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have no son.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dead?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dead. I have murdered both.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But Gladys?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dying; she asks for you,—come!” No
need of that hoarse command; Helwyze was
gone at the first word, swiftly through room and
hall, up the stairs he had not mounted for
months, straight to that chamber-door. There
a hand clutched his shoulder, a breathless voice
said, “Here <em>I</em> am first;” and Canaris passed in
before him, motioning away a group of tearful
women as he went.</p>

<p class='c006'>Helwyze lingered, pale and panting, till they
were gone; then he looked and listened, as if
turned to stone, for in the heart of the hush
lay Gladys, talking softly to the dead baby on
her arm. Not mourning over it, but yearning
with maternal haste to follow and cherish the
creature of her love.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Only a day old; so young to go away alone.
Even in heaven you will want your mother, darling,
and she will come. Sleep, my baby, I will
be with you when you wake.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>A stifled sound of anguish recalled the happy
soul, already half-way home, and Gladys turned
her quiet eyes to her husband bending over her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dear, will he come?” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He is here.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He was; and, standing on either side the bed,
the two men seemed unconscious of each other,
intent only upon her. Feebly she drew the
white cover over the little cold thing in her
bosom, as if too sacred for any eyes but hers to
see, then lifted up her hand with a beseeching
glance from one haggard face to the other.
They understood; each gave the hand she asked,
and, holding them together with the last effort
of failing strength, she said, clear and low,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Forgive each other for my sake.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Neither spoke, having no words, but by a
mute gesture answered as she wished. Something
brighter than a smile rested on her face,
and, as if satisfied, she turned again to Canaris,
seeming to forget all else in the tender farewell
she gave him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Remember, love, remember we shall be
waiting for you. The new home will not be
home to us until you come.”</p>

<p class='c006'>As her detaining touch was lifted, the two
hands fell apart, never to meet again. Canaris
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>knelt down to lay his head beside hers on the
pillow, to catch the last accents of the beloved
voice, sweet even now. Helwyze, forgotten by
them both, drew back into the shadow of the
deep red curtains, still studying with an awful
curiosity the great mystery of death, asking,
even while his heart grew cold within him,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Will the faith she trusted sustain her now?”</p>

<p class='c006'>It did; for, leaning on the bosom of Infinite
Love, like a confiding child in its father’s arms,
without a doubt or fear to mar her peace, a
murmur or lament to make the parting harder,
Gladys went to her own place.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>XVIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>“For in that sleep of death, what dreams
may come. Is this one?” was the vague
feeling, rather than thought, of which Helwyze
was dimly conscious, as he lay in what seemed
a grave, so cold, so dead he felt; so powerless
and pent, in what he fancied was his coffin. He
remembered the slow rising of a tide of helplessness
which chilled his blood and benumbed his
brain, till the last idea to be distinguished was,
“I am dying: shall I meet Gladys?” then came
oblivion, and now, what was this?</p>

<p class='c006'>Something was alive still—something which
strove to see, move, speak, yet could not, till the
mist, which obscured every sense, should clear
away. A murmur was in the air, growing
clearer every instant, as it rose and fell, like
the muffled sound of waves upon a distant
shore. Presently he recognized human voices,
and the words they uttered,—words which had
no meaning, till, like an electric shock, intelligence
returned, bringing with it a great fear.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>Olivia was mourning over him, and he felt her
tears upon his face; but it was not this which
stung him to sudden life,—it was another voice,
saying, low, but with a terrible distinctness,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“There is no hope. He may remain so for
some years; but sooner or later the brain will
share the paralysis of the body, and leave our
poor friend in a state I grieve to think of.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No!” burst from Helwyze, with an effort
which seemed to dispel the trance which held
his faculties. Stir he could not, but speak he
did, and opened wide the eyes which had been
closed for hours. With the unutterable relief
of one roused from a nightmare he recognized
his own room, Olivia’s tender face bent over
him, and his physician holding a hand that had
no feeling in it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not dead yet;” he muttered, with a feeble
sort of exultation, adding, with as feeble a
despair and doubt, “but <em>she</em> is. Did I dream
that?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Alas, no!” and Olivia wiped away her own
tears from the forehead which began to work
with the rush of returning memory and thought.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What does this numbness mean? Why are
you here?” he asked, as his eye went from one
face to the other.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>“Dear Jasper, it means that you are ill. Stern
found you unconscious in your chair last night.
You are much better now, but it alarmed us, for
we thought you dead,” replied Olivia, knowing
that he would have the truth at any cost.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I remember thinking it was death, and being
glad of it. Why did you bring me back? I had
no wish to come.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She forgave the ingratitude, and went on
chafing the cold hand so tenderly, that Helwyze
reproached no more, but, turning to the physician,
demanded, with a trace of the old imperiousness
coming back into his feeble voice,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is this to be the end of it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I fear so, Mr. Helwyze. You will not suffer
any more, let that comfort you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“My body may not, but my mind will suffer
horribly. Good heavens, man, do you call this
death in life a comfortable end? How long
have I got to lie here watching my wits go?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is impossible to say.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But certain, sooner or later?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“There is a chance,—your brain has been
overworked: it must have rest,” began the doctor,
trying to soften the hard facts, since his patient
would have them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Rest! kill me at once, then; annihilation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>would be far better than such rest as that. I
will not lie here waiting for imbecility,—put an
end to this, or let me!” cried Helwyze, struggling
to lift his powerless right hand; and, finding
it impossible, he looked about him with an
impotent desperation which wrung Olivia’s heart,
and alarmed the physician, although he had long
foreseen this climax.</p>

<p class='c006'>Both vainly tried to soothe and console; but
after that one despairing appeal Helwyze turned
his face to the wall, and lay so for hours.
Asleep, they hoped, but in reality tasting the
first bitterness of the punishment sent upon
him as an expiation for the sin of misusing one
of Heaven’s best gifts. No words could describe
the terror such a fate had for him, since intellect
had been his god, and he already felt it tottering
to its fall. On what should he lean, if that were
taken? where see any ray of hope to make the
present endurable? where find any resignation
to lighten the gloom of such a future?</p>

<p class='c006'>Restless mind and lawless will, now imprisoned
in a helpless body, preyed on each other
like wild creatures caged, finding it impossible
to escape, and as impossible to submit. Death
would not have daunted him, pain he had learned
to endure; but this slow decay of his most precious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>possession he could not bear, and suffered
a new martyrdom infinitely sharper than the old.</p>

<p class='c006'>How time went he never knew; for, although
merciful unconsciousness was denied him, his
thoughts, like avenging Furies, drove him from
one bitter memory to another, probing his soul
as he had probed others, and tormenting him
with an almost supernatural activity of brain before
its long rest began. Ages seemed to pass,
while he took no heed of what went on about
him. People came and went, faces bent over
him, hands ministered to him, and voices whispered
in the room. He knew all this, without
the desire to do so, longing only to forget and
be forgotten, with an increasing irritation, which
slowly brought him back from that inner world
of wordless pain to the outer one, which must
be faced, and in some fashion endured.</p>

<p class='c006'>Olivia still sat near him, as if she had not
stirred, though it was morning when last he
spoke, and now night had come. The familiar
room was dim and still, every thing already ordered
for his comfort, and the brilliant cousin
had transformed herself into a quiet nurse. The
rustling silks were replaced by a soft, gray gown;
the ornaments all gone; even the fine hair was
half-hidden by the little kerchief of lace tied over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>it. Yet never had Olivia been more beautiful;
for now the haughty queen had changed to a
sad woman, wearing for her sole ornaments constancy
and love. Worn and weary she looked,
but a sort of sorrowful content was visible, a
jealous tenderness, which plainly told that for
her, at least, there was a drop of honey even in
the new affliction, since it made him more her
own than ever.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Poor soul! she promised to be faithful to
the death; and she will be,—even such a death
as this.”</p>

<p class='c006'>A sigh, that was almost a groan, broke from
Helwyze as the thought came, and Olivia was
instantly at his side.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Are you suffering, Jasper? What can I do
for you?” she said, with such a passionate desire
to serve or cheer, that he could not but answer,
gently,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am done with pain: teach me to be
patient.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, if I could! we must learn that together,”
she said, feeling with him how sorely
both would need the meek virtue to sustain the
life before them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where is Felix?” asked Helwyze, after
lying for a while, with his eyes upon the fire, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>if they would absorb its light and warmth into
their melancholy depths.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mourning for Gladys,” replied Olivia, fearing
to touch the dangerous topic, yet anxious to
know how the two men stood toward one another;
for something in the manner of the
younger, when the elder was mentioned, made
her suspect some stronger, sadder tie between
them than the one she had already guessed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Does he know of this?” and Helwyze struck
himself a feeble blow with the one hand which
he could use, now lying on his breast.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What does he say of me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nothing.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I must see him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You shall. I asked him if he had no word
for you, and he answered, with a strange expression,
‘When I have buried my dead I will come,
for the last time.’”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How does he look?” questioned Helwyze,
curious to see, even through another’s eyes, the
effect of sorrow upon the man whom he had
watched so long and closely.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sadly broken; but he is young and sanguine:
he will soon forget, and be happy again;
so do not let a thought of him disturb you,
Jasper.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>“It does not: we made our bargain, and held
each other to it, till he chose to break it. Let
him bear the consequences, as I do.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Alas, they fall on him far less heavily than
on you! He has all the world before him
where to choose, while you have nothing left—but
me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He did not seem to hear her, and fell into a
gloomy reverie, which she dared not break, but
sat, patiently beguiling her lonely watch with
sad thoughts of the twilight future they were to
share together,—a future which might have been
so beautiful and happy, had true love earlier
made them one.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another day, another night, then there were
sounds about the house which told Helwyze what
was passing, without the need of any question.
He asked none; but lay silent for the most
part, as if careless or unconscious of what went
on around him. He missed Olivia for an hour,
and when she returned, traces of tears upon her
cheeks told him that she had been to say farewell
to Gladys. He had not spoken that name
even to himself; for now an immeasurable space
seemed to lie between him and its gentle owner.
She had gone into a world whither he could not
follow her. A veil, invisible, yet impenetrable,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>separated them for ever, he believed, and nothing
remained to him but a memory that would not
die,—a memory so bitter-sweet, so made up of
remorse and reverence, love and longing, that it
seemed to waken his heart from its long sleep,
and kindle in it a spark of the divine fire, whose
flame purified while it consumed; for even in
his darkness and desolation he was not forgotten.</p>

<p class='c006'>Late that day Canaris came, looking like a
man escaped from a great shipwreck, with nothing
left him but his life. Unannounced he
entered, and, with the brevity which in moments
of strong feeling is more expressive than eloquence,
he said,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am going.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where?” asked Helwyze, conscious that any
semblance of friendship, any word of sympathy,
was impossible between them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Out into the world again.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What will you do?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Any <em>honest</em> work I can find.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let me”—</p>

<p class='c006'>“No! I will take nothing from you. Poor as
I came, I will go,—except the few relics I possess
of her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>A traitorous tremor in the voice which was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>stern with repressed emotion warned Canaris
to pause there, while his eye turned to Olivia,
as if reminded of some last debt to her. From
his breast he drew a little paper, unfolded it, and
took out what looked like a massive ring of gold;
this he laid before her, saying, with a softened
mien and accent,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“You were very kind,—I have nothing else
to offer,—let me give you this, in memory of
Gladys.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Only a tress of sunny hair; but Olivia received
the gift as if it were a very precious one,
thanking him, not only with wet eyes, but friendly
words.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dear Felix, for her sake let <em>me</em> help you, if I
can. Do not go away so lonely, purposeless, and
poor. The world is hard; you will be disheartened,
and turn desperate, with no one to love and
hope and work for.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I must help myself. I am poor; but not
purposeless, nor alone. Disheartened I may be:
never desperate again; for I <em>have</em> some one to
love and hope and work for. She is waiting for
me somewhere: I must make myself worthy to
follow and find her. I have promised; and, God
helping me, I will keep that promise.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Very humble, yet hopeful, was the voice; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>full of a sad courage was the young man’s altered
face,—for out of it the gladness and the bloom
of youth had gone for ever, leaving the strength
of a noble purpose to confront a life which hereafter
should be honest, if not happy.</p>

<p class='c006'>Helwyze had not the infinite patience to work
in marble; the power to chisel even his own
divided nature into harmony, like the sculptor,
who, in the likeness of a suffering saint, hewed
his own features out of granite. He could only
work in clay, as caprice inspired or circumstance
suggested; forgetting that life’s stream of
mixed and molten metals would flow over his
faulty models, fixing unalterably both beauty and
blemish. He had found the youth plastic as
clay, had shaped him as he would; till, tiring of
the task, he had been ready to destroy his work.
But the hand of a greater Master had dropped
into the furnace the gold of an enduring love, to
brighten the bronze in which suffering and time
were to cast the statue of the <em>man</em>. Helwyze
saw this now, and a pang of something sharper
than remorse wrung from him the reluctant
words,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Take, as my last gift, the fame which has
cost you so much. I will never claim it: to me
it is an added affliction, to you it may be a help.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>Keep it, I implore you, and give me the pardon
<em>she</em> asked of you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But Canaris turned on him with the air of one
who cries, “Get thee behind me!” and answered
with enough of the old vehemence to prove that
grief had not yet subdued the passionate spirit
which had been his undoing,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is no longer in your power to tempt me,
or in mine to be tempted, by my bosom sin.
Forsythe knows the truth, and the world already
wonders. I will earn a better fame for myself:
keep this, and enjoy it, if you can. Pardon I
cannot promise yet; but I give you my pity,
‘for her sake.’”</p>

<p class='c006'>With that—the bitterest word he could have
uttered—Canaris was gone, leaving Helwyze to
writhe under the double burden imposed by one
more just than generous. Olivia durst not speak;
and, in the silence, both listened to the hasty
footsteps that passed from room to room, till a
door closed loudly, and they knew that Canaris
had set forth upon that long pilgrimage which
was in time to lead him up to Gladys.</p>

<p class='c006'>Helwyze spoke first, exclaiming, with a dreary
laugh,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“So much for playing Providence! You were
right, and I <em>was</em> rash to try it. Goethe could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>make his Satan as he liked; but Fate was
stronger than I, and so comes ignominious failure.
Margaret dies, and Faust suffers, but Mephistopheles
cannot go with him on his new wanderings.
Still, it holds—it holds even to the last!
My end comes too soon; yet it is true. In loving
the angel I lose the soul I had nearly won;
the roses turn to flakes of fire, and the poor
devil is left lamenting.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Olivia thought him wandering, and listened
in alarm; for his thoughts seemed blown to and
fro, like leaves in a fitful gust, and she had no
clew to them. Presently, he broke out again,
still haunted by the real tragedy in which he had
borne a part; still following Canaris, whose freedom
was like the thought of water to parched
Tantalus.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He will do it! he will do it! When or
how, who shall say? but, soon or late, she will
save him, since he believes in such salvation.
Would that I did!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Perhaps the despairing wish was the seed of a
future hope, which might blossom into belief.
Olivia trusted so, and tried to murmur some
comfortable, though vague, assurance of a love
and pity greater even than hers. He did not
hear her; for his eyes were fixed, with an expression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>of agonized yearning, upon the sky,
serene and beautiful, but infinitely distant, inexorably
dumb; and, when he spoke, his words
had in them both his punishment and her
own,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Life before was Purgatory, now it is Hell;
because I loved her, and <em>I</em> have no hope to follow
and find her again.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>A WHISPER IN THE DARK.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c005'>As we rolled along, I scanned my companion covertly,
and saw much to interest a girl of seventeen.
My uncle was a handsome man, with all the
polish of foreign life fresh upon him; yet it was neither
comeliness nor graceful ease which most attracted me;
for even my inexperienced eye caught glimpses of
something stern and sombre below these external
charms, and my long scrutiny showed me the keenest
eye, the hardest mouth, the subtlest smile I ever saw,—a
face which in repose wore the look which comes
to those who have led lives of pleasure and learned
their emptiness. He seemed intent on some thought
that absorbed him, and for a time rendered him forgetful
of my presence, as he sat with folded arms, fixed
eyes, and restless lips. While I looked, my own mind
was full of deeper thought than it had ever been before;
for I was recalling, word for word, a paragraph in that
half-read letter:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“At eighteen Sybil is to marry her cousin, the compact having
been made between my brother and myself in their childhood. My
son is with me now, and I wish them to be together during the
next few months, therefore my niece must leave you sooner than
I at first intended. Oblige me by preparing her for an immediate
and final separation, but leave all disclosures to me, as I prefer
the girl to remain ignorant of the matter for the present.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>That displeased me. Why was I to remain ignorant
of so important an affair? Then I smiled to
myself, remembering that I did know, thanks to the
wilful curiosity that prompted me to steal a peep into
the letter that Madame Bernard had pored over with
such an anxious face. I saw only a single paragraph,
for my own name arrested my eye; and, though wild to
read all, I had scarcely time to whisk the paper back
into the reticule the forgetful old soul had left hanging
on the arm of her chair. It was enough, however, to
set my girlish brain in a ferment, and keep me gazing
wistfully at my uncle, conscious that my future now
lay in his hands; for I was an orphan and he my guardian,
though I had seen him but seldom since I was
confided to madame a six years’ child. Presently
my uncle became cognizant of my steady stare, and
returned it with one as steady for a moment, then said,
in a low, smooth tone, that ill accorded with the satirical
smile that touched his lips,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am a dull companion for my little niece. How
shall I provide her with pleasanter amusement than
counting my wrinkles or guessing my thoughts?”</p>

<p class='c006'>I was a frank, fearless creature, quick to feel, speak,
and act, so I answered readily,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Tell me about my cousin Guy. Is he as handsome,
brave, and clever as madame says his father was when
a boy?”</p>

<p class='c006'>My uncle laughed a short laugh, touched with scorn,
whether for madame, himself, or me I could not tell, for
his countenance was hard to read.</p>

<p class='c006'>“A girl’s question and artfully put; nevertheless I
shall not answer it, but let you judge for yourself.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>“But, sir, it will amuse me and beguile the way. I
feel a little strange and forlorn at leaving madame, and
talking of my new home and friends will help me to
know and love them sooner. Please tell me, for I’ve
had my own way all my life, and can’t bear to be
crossed.”</p>

<p class='c006'>My petulance seemed to amuse him, and I became
aware that he was observing me with a scrutiny as
keen as my own had been; but I smilingly sustained
it, for my vanity was pleased by the approbation his
eye betrayed. The evident interest he now took in
all I said and did was sufficient flattery for a young
thing, who felt her charms and longed to try their
power.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I, too, have had my own way all my life; and as
the life is double the length, the will is double the
strength of yours, and again I say no. What next,
mademoiselle?”</p>

<p class='c006'>He was blander than ever as he spoke, but I was
piqued, and resolved to try coaxing, eager to gain my
point, lest a too early submission now should mar my
freedom in the future.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But that is ungallant, uncle, and I still have hopes
of a kinder answer, both because you are too generous
to refuse so small a favor to your ‘little niece,’ and
because she can be charmingly wheedlesome when she
likes. Won’t you say yes now, uncle?” and, pleased
with the daring of the thing, I put my arm about his
neck, kissed him daintily, and perched myself upon his
knee with most audacious ease.</p>

<p class='c006'>He regarded me mutely for an instant, then holding
me fast deliberately returned my salute on lips, cheeks,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>and forehead, with such warmth that I turned scarlet
and struggled to free myself, while he laughed that
mirthless laugh of his till my shame turned to anger,
and I imperiously commanded him to let me go.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not yet, young lady. You came here for your
own pleasure, but shall stay for mine, till I tame you
as I see you must be tamed. It is a short process with
me, and I possess experience in the work; for Guy,
though by nature as wild as a hawk, has learned to
come at my call as meekly as a dove. Chut! what a
little fury it is!”</p>

<p class='c006'>I was just then; for exasperated at his coolness, and
quite beside myself, I had suddenly stooped and bitten
the shapely white hand that held both my own. I had
better have submitted; for slight as the foolish action
was, it had an influence on my after life as many another
such has had. My uncle stopped laughing, his hand
tightened its grasp, for a moment his cold eye glittered
and a grim look settled round the mouth, giving to his
whole face a ruthless expression that entirely altered it.
I felt perfectly powerless. All my little arts had failed,
and for the first time I was mastered. Yet only physically;
my spirit was rebellious still. He saw it in the
glance that met his own, as I sat erect and pale, with
something more than childish anger. I think it pleased
him, for swiftly as it had come the dark look passed,
and quietly, as if we were the best of friends, he began
to relate certain exciting adventures he had known
abroad, lending to the picturesque narration the charm
of that peculiarly melodious voice, which soothed
and won me in spite of myself, holding me intent till
I forgot the past; and when he paused I found that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>I was leaning confidentially on his shoulder, asking
for more, yet conscious of an instinctive distrust of
this man whom I had so soon learned to fear yet
fancy.</p>

<p class='c006'>As I was recalled to myself, I endeavored to leave
him; but he still detained me, and, with a curious
expression, produced a case so quaintly fashioned that
I cried out in admiration, while he selected two cigarettes,
mildly aromatic with the herbs they were
composed of, lit them, offered me one, dropped the
window, and leaning back surveyed me with an air
of extreme enjoyment, as I sat meekly puffing and
wondering what prank I should play a part in next.
Slowly the narcotic influence of the herbs diffused
itself like a pleasant haze over all my senses; sleep, the
most grateful, fell upon my eyelids, and the last thing
I remember was my uncle’s face dreamily regarding me
through a cloud of fragrant smoke. Twilight wrapped
us in its shadows when I woke, with the night wind
blowing on my forehead, the muffled roll of wheels
sounding in my ear, and my cheek pillowed upon my
uncle’s arm. He was humming a French <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>chanson</i></span>
about “Love and Wine, and the Seine to-morrow!” I
listened till I caught the air, and presently joined him,
mingling my girlish treble with his flute-like tenor.
He stopped at once, and, in the coolly courteous tone I
had always heard in our few interviews, asked if I was
ready for lights and home.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Are we there?” I cried; and looking out saw that
we were ascending an avenue which swept up to a pile
of buildings that rose tall and dark against the sky, with
here and there a gleam along its gray front.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>“Home at last, thank Heaven!” And springing out
with the agility of a young man, my uncle led me over
a terrace into a long hall, light and warm, and odorous
with the breath of flowers blossoming here and there
in graceful groups. A civil, middle-aged maid received
and took me to my room, a bijou of a place, which
increased my wonder when told that my uncle had
chosen all its decorations and superintended their
arrangement. “He understands women,” I thought,
handling the toilet ornaments, trying luxurious chair
and lounge, and ending by slipping my feet into the
scarlet and white Turkish slippers, coquettishly turning
up their toes before the fire. A few moments I
gave to examination, and, having expressed my satisfaction,
was asked by my maid if I would be pleased to
dress, as “the master” never allowed dinner to wait
for any one. This recalled to me the fact that I was
doubtless to meet my future husband at that meal, and
in a moment every faculty was intent upon achieving a
grand toilette for this first interview. The maid possessed
skill and taste, and I a wardrobe lately embellished
with Parisian gifts from my uncle which I was
eager to display in his honor.</p>

<p class='c006'>When ready, I surveyed myself in the long mirror as
I had never done before, and saw there a little figure,
slender, yet stately, in a dress of foreign fashion, ornamented
with lace and carnation ribbons which enhanced
the fairness of neck and arms, while blonde
hair, wavy and golden, was gathered into an antique
knot of curls behind, with a carnation fillet, and below
a blooming dark-eyed face, just then radiant with girlish
vanity and eagerness and hope.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>“I’m glad I’m pretty!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“So am I, Sybil.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I had unconsciously spoken aloud, and the echo came
from the doorway where stood my uncle, carefully
dressed, looking comelier and cooler than ever. The
disagreeable smile flitted over his lips as he spoke, and
I started, then stood abashed, till beckoning, he added
in his most courtly manner,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“You were so absorbed in the contemplation of your
charming self, that Janet answered my tap and took
herself away unheard. You are mistress of my table
now: it waits; will you come down?”</p>

<p class='c006'>With a last touch to that unruly hair of mine, a
last, comprehensive glance and shake, I took the offered
arm and rustled down the wide staircase, feeling
that the romance of my life was about to begin.
Three covers were laid, three chairs set, but only two
were occupied, for no Guy appeared. I asked no questions,
showed no surprise, but tried to devour my chagrin
with my dinner, and exerted myself to charm my
uncle into the belief that I had forgotten my cousin.
It was a failure, however, for that empty seat had an
irresistible fascination for me, and more than once, as
my eye returned from its furtive scrutiny of napkin,
plate, and trio of colored glasses, it met my uncle’s and
fell before his penetrative glance. When I gladly rose
to leave him to his wine,—for he did not ask me to
remain,—he also rose, and, as he held the door for me,
he said,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“You asked me to describe your cousin: you have
seen one trait of his character to-night; does it please
you?”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>I knew he was as much vexed as I at Guy’s absence,
so quoting his own words I answered saucily,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes; for I’d rather see the hawk free than coming
tamely at your call, uncle.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He frowned slightly, as if unused to such liberty of
speech, yet bowed when I swept him a stately little
curtsey and sailed away to the drawing-room, wondering
if my uncle was as angry with me as I was with
my cousin. In solitary grandeur I amused myself by
strolling through the suite of handsome rooms henceforth
to be my realm, looked at myself in the long
mirrors, as every woman is apt to do when alone and
in costume, danced over the mossy carpets, touched the
grand piano, smelt the flowers, fingered the ornaments
on <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>étagère</i></span> and table, and was just giving my handkerchief
a second drench of some refreshing perfume from
a filigree flask that had captivated me, when the hall
door was flung wide, a quick step went running upstairs,
boots tramped overhead, drawers seemed hastily
opened and shut, and a bold, blithe voice broke out
into a hunting song in a tone so like my uncle’s that I
involuntarily flew to the door, crying,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Guy is come!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Fortunately for my dignity, no one heard me, and
hurrying back I stood ready to skim into a chair and
assume propriety at a minute’s notice, conscious, meanwhile,
of the new influence which seemed suddenly to
gift the silent house with vitality, and add the one
charm it needed,—that of cheerful companionship.
“How will he meet me? and how shall I meet him?”
I thought, looking up at the bright-faced boy, whose
portrait looked back at me with a mirthful light in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>painted eyes and a trace of his father’s disdainful smile
in the curves of the firm-set lips. Presently the quick
steps came flying down again, past the door, straight
to the dining-room opposite, and, as I stood listening
with a strange flutter at my heart, I heard an imperious
young voice say rapidly,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Beg pardon, sir, unavoidably detained. Has she
come? Is she bearable?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I find her so. Dinner is over, and I can offer you
nothing but a glass of wine.”</p>

<p class='c006'>My uncle’s voice was frostily polite, making a curious
contrast to the other, so impetuous and frank, as if
used to command or win all but one.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Never mind the dinner! I’m glad to be rid of it;
so I’ll drink your health, father, and then inspect our
new ornament.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Impertinent boy!” I muttered, yet at the same
moment resolved to deserve his appellation, and immediately
grouped myself as effectively as possible, laughing
at my folly as I did so. I possessed a pretty foot,
therefore one little slipper appeared quite naturally
below the last flounce of my dress; a bracelet glittered
on my arm as it emerged from among the lace and carnation
knots; that arm supported my head. My profile
was well cut, my eyelashes long, therefore I read
with face half averted from the door. The light showered
down, turning my hair to gold; so I smoothed my
curls, retied my snood, and, after a satisfied survey,
composed myself with an absorbed aspect and a quickened
pulse to await the arrival of the gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c006'>Soon they came. I knew they paused on the threshold,
but never stirred till an irrepressible, “You are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>right, sir!” escaped the younger. Then I rose prepared
to give him the coldest greeting, yet I did not.
I had almost expected to meet the boyish face and
figure of the picture; I saw, instead, a man comely and
tall. A dark moustache half hid the proud mouth; the
vivacious eyes were far kinder, though quite as keen as
his father’s, and the freshness of unspoiled youth lent a
charm which the older man had lost for ever. Guy’s
glance of pleased surprise was flatteringly frank, his
smile so cordial, his “Welcome, cousin!” such a hearty
sound, that my coldness melted in a breath, my dignity
was all forgotten, and before I could restrain myself
I had offered both hands with the impulsive exclamation,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Cousin Guy, I know I shall be very happy here!
Are you glad I have come?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Glad as I am to see the sun after a November
fog.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And, bending his tall head, he kissed my hand in the
graceful foreign fashion he had learned abroad. It
pleased me mightily, for it was both affectionate and
respectful. Involuntarily I contrasted it with my
uncle’s manner, and flashed a significant glance at him
as I did so. He understood it, but only nodded with
the satirical look I hated, shook out his paper and
began to read. I sat down again, careless of myself
now; and Guy stood on the rug, surveying me with an
expression of surprise that rather nettled my pride.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He is only a boy, after all; so I need not be daunted
by his inches or his airs. I wonder if he knows I am
to be his wife, and likes it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The thought sent the color to my forehead, my eyes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>fell, and despite my valiant resolution, I sat like any
bashful child before my handsome cousin. Guy laughed
a boyish laugh as he sat down on his father’s footstool,
saying, while he warmed his slender brown hands,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“I beg your pardon, Sybil. (We won’t be formal,
will we?) But I haven’t seen a lady for a month, so I
stare like a boor at sight of a silk gown and high-bred
face. Are those people coming, sir?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“If Sybil likes, ask her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Shall we have a flock of people here to make it gay
for you, cousin, or do you prefer our quiet style better;
just riding, driving, lounging, and enjoying life, each
in his own way? Henceforth it is to be as you command
in such matters.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let things go on as they have done, then. I don’t
care for society, and strangers wouldn’t make it gay to
me, for I like freedom; so do you, I think.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah, don’t I!”</p>

<p class='c006'>A cloud flitted over his smiling face, and he punched
the fire, as if some vent were necessary for the sudden
gust of petulance that knit his black brows into a
frown, and caused his father to tap him on the shoulder
with the bland request, as he rose to leave the
room,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Bring the portfolios and entertain your cousin; I
have letters to write, and Sybil is too tired to care for
music to-night.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Guy obeyed with a shrug of the shoulder his father
touched, but lingered in the recess till my uncle, having
made his apologies to me, had left the room; then
my cousin rejoined me, wearing the same cordial
aspect I first beheld. Some restraint was evidently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>removed, and his natural self appeared. A very winsome
self it was, courteous, gay, and frank, with an
undertone of deeper feeling than I thought to find. I
watched him covertly, and soon owned to myself that
he was all I most admired in the ideal hero every girl
creates in her romantic fancy; for I no longer looked
upon this young man as my cousin, but my lover, and
through all our future intercourse this thought was
always uppermost, full of a charm that never lost its
power.</p>

<p class='c006'>Before the evening ended Guy was kneeling on the
rug beside me, our two heads close together, while he
turned the contents of the great portfolio spread before
us, looking each other freely in the face, as I listened
and he described, both breaking into frequent peals of
laughter at some odd adventure or comical mishap in
his own travels, suggested by the pictured scenes before
us. Guy was very charming, I my blithest, sweetest
self, and when we parted late, my cousin watched me
up the stairs with still another, “Good-night, Sybil,”
as if both sight and sound were pleasant to him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is that your horse Sultan?” I called from my
window next morning, as I looked down upon my
cousin, who was coming up the drive from an early
gallop on the moors.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, bonny Sybil; come and admire him,” he called
back, hat in hand, and a quick smile rippling over his
face.</p>

<p class='c006'>I went, and, standing on the terrace, caressed the
handsome creature, while Guy said, glancing up at his
father’s undrawn curtains,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“If your saddle had come, we would take a turn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>before ‘my lord’ is ready for breakfast. This autumn
air is the wine you women need.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I yearned to go, and when I willed the way soon
appeared; so careless of bonnetless head and cambric
gown, I stretched my hands to him, saying boldly,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Play young Lochinvar, Guy; I am little and light;
take me up before you and show me the sea.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He liked the daring feat, held out his hand, I stepped
on his boot toe, sprang up, and away we went over the
wide moor, where the sun shone in a cloudless heaven,
the lark soared singing from the green grass at our feet,
and the September wind blew freshly from the sea.
As we paused on the upland slope, that gave us a free
view of the country for miles, Guy dismounted, and,
standing with his arm about the saddle to steady me in
my precarious seat, began to talk.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you like your new home, cousin?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“More than I can tell you!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And my father, Sybil?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Both yes and no to that question, Guy; I hardly
know him yet.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“True, but you must not expect to find him as
indulgent and fond as many guardians would be to
such as you. It’s not his nature. Yet you can win
his heart by obedience, and soon grow quite at ease
with him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Bless you! I’m that already, for I fear no one.
Why, I sat on his knee yesterday and smoked a cigarette
of his own offering, though madame would have
fainted if she had seen me; then I slept on his arm an
hour, and he was fatherly kind, though I teased him
like a gnat.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>“The deuce he was!” with which energetic expression
Guy frowned at the landscape and harshly checked
Sultan’s attempt to browse, while I wondered what
was amiss between father and son, and resolved to
discover; but, finding the conversation at an end,
started it afresh, by asking,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is any of my property in this part of the country,
Guy? Do you know I am as ignorant as a baby about
my own affairs; for, as long as every whim was gratified
and my purse full, I left the rest to madame and
uncle, though the first hadn’t a bit of judgment, and
the last I scarcely knew. I never cared to ask questions
before, but now I am intensely curious to know
how matters stand.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“All you see is yours, Sybil,” was the brief answer.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What, that great house, the lovely gardens, these
moors, and the forest stretching to the sea? I’m
glad! I’m glad! But where, then, is your home,
Guy?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nowhere.”</p>

<p class='c006'>At this I looked so amazed, that his gloom vanished
in a laugh, as he explained, but briefly, as if this
subject were no pleasanter than the first,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“By your father’s will you were desired to take possession
of the old place at eighteen. You will be that
soon; therefore, as your guardian, my father has prepared
things for you, and is to share your home until
you marry.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“When will that be, I wonder?” and I stole a
glance from under my lashes, wild to discover if Guy
knew of the compact and was a willing party to it.
His face was half averted, but over his dark cheek I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>saw a deep flush rise, as he answered, stooping to pull
a bit of heather,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Soon, I hope, or the gentleman sleeping there below
will be tempted to remain a fixture with you on his
knee as ‘madame my wife.’ He is not your own uncle,
you know.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I smiled at the idea, but Guy did not see it; and
seized with a whim to try my skill with the hawk
that seemed inclined to peck at its master, I said demurely,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, why not? I might be very happy if I
learned to love him, as I should, if he were always in
that kindest mood of his. Would you like me for a
little mamma, Guy?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No!” short and sharp as a pistol shot.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then you must marry and have a home of your
own, my son.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t, Sybil! I’d rather you didn’t see me in a
rage, for I’m not a pleasant sight, I assure you; and
I’m afraid I shall be in one if you go on. I early lost
my mother, but I love her tenderly, because my father
is not much to me, and I know if she had lived I should
not be what I am.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Bitter was his voice, moody his mien, and all the
sunshine gone at once. I looked down and touched
his black hair with a shy caress, feeling both penitent
and pitiful.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dear Guy, forgive me if I pained you. I’m a
thoughtless creature, but I’m not malicious, and a
word will restrain me if kindly spoken. My home is
always yours, and when my fortune is mine you shall
never want, if you are not too proud to accept help
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>from your own kin. You are a little proud, aren’t
you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“As Lucifer, to most people. I think I should not
be to you, for you understand me, Sybil, and with you
I hope to grow a better man.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He turned then, and through the lineaments his
father had bequeathed him I saw a look that must
have been his mother’s, for it was womanly, sweet, and
soft, and lent new beauty to the dark eyes, always kind,
and just then very tender. He had checked his words
suddenly, like one who has gone too far, and with that
hasty look into my face had bent his own upon the
ground, as if to hide the unwonted feeling that had
mastered him. It lasted but a moment, then his old
manner returned, as he said gayly,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“There drops your slipper. I’ve been wondering
what kept it on. Pretty thing! They say it is a foot
like this that oftenest tramples on men’s hearts. Are
you cruel to your lovers, Sybil?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I never had one, for madame guarded me like a
dragon, and I led the life of a nun; but when I do find
one I shall try his mettle well before I give up my
liberty.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Poets say it is sweet to give up liberty for love,
and they ought to know,” answered Guy, with a sidelong
glance.</p>

<p class='c006'>I liked that little speech, and recollecting the wistful
look he had given me, the significant words that
had escaped him, and the variations of tone and manner
constantly succeeding one another, I felt assured
that my cousin was cognizant of the family league, and
accepted it, yet, with the shyness of a young lover,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>knew not how to woo. This pleased me, and, quite
satisfied with my morning’s work, I mentally resolved
to charm my cousin slowly, and enjoy the romance of a
genuine wooing, without which no woman’s life seems
complete,—in her own eyes, at least. He had gathered
me a knot of purple heather, and as he gave it I
smiled my sweetest on him, saying,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“I commission you to supply me with nosegays, for
you have taste, and I love wild-flowers. I shall wear
this at dinner in honor of its giver. Now take me
home; for my moors, though beautiful, are chilly, and
I have no wrapper but this microscopic handkerchief.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Off went his riding-jacket, and I was half smothered
in it. The hat followed next, and as he sprung up
behind I took the reins, and felt a thrill of delight in
sweeping down the slope with that mettlesome creature
tugging at the bit, that strong arm round me, and the
happy hope that the heart I leaned on might yet learn
to love me.</p>

<p class='c006'>The day so began passed pleasantly, spent in roving
over house and grounds with my cousin, setting my
possessions in order, and writing to dear old madame.
Twilight found me in my bravest attire, with Guy’s
heather in my hair, listening for his step, and longing
to run and meet him when he came. Punctual to the
instant he appeared, and this dinner was a far different
one from that of yesterday, for both father and son
seemed in their gayest and most gallant mood, and I
enjoyed the hour heartily. The world seemed all in
tune now, and when I went to the drawing-room I
was moved to play my most stirring marches, sing my
blithest songs, hoping to bring one at least of the gentlemen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>to join me. It brought both, and my first
glance showed me a curious change in each. My
uncle looked harassed and yet amused, Guy looked
sullen and eyed his father with covert glances.</p>

<p class='c006'>The morning’s chat flashed into my mind, and I
asked myself, “Is Guy jealous so soon?” It looked a
little like it, for he threw himself upon a couch and lay
there silent and morose; while my uncle paced to and
fro, thinking deeply, while apparently listening to the
song he bade me finish. I did so, then followed the
whim that now possessed me, for I wanted to try my
power over them both, to see if I could restore that
gentler mood of my uncle’s, and assure myself that Guy
cared whether I was friendliest with him or not.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Uncle, come and sing with me; I like that voice
of yours.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Tut, I am too old for that; take this indolent lad
instead, his voice is fresh and young, and will chord
well with yours.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you know that pretty <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>chanson</i></span> about ‘Love and
Wine, and the Seine to-morrow,’ cousin Guy?” I asked,
stealing a sly glance at my uncle.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Who taught you that?” and Guy eyed me over
the top of the couch with an astonished expression
which greatly amused me.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No one; uncle sang a bit of it in the carriage yesterday.
I like the air, so come and teach me the
rest.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is no song for you, Sybil. You choose strange
entertainment for a lady, sir.”</p>

<p class='c006'>A look of unmistakable contempt was in the son’s
eye, of momentary annoyance in the father’s, yet his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>voice betrayed none as he answered, still pacing placidly
along the room,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“I thought she was asleep, and unconsciously began
it to beguile a silent drive. Sing on, Sybil; that Bacchanalian
snatch will do you no harm.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But I was tired of music now they had come, so I
went to him, and, passing my arm through his, walked
beside him, saying with my most persuasive aspect,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Tell me about Paris, uncle; I intend to go there
as soon as I’m of age, if you will let me. Does your
guardianship extend beyond that time?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Only till you marry.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I shall be in no haste, then, for I begin to feel quite
homelike and happy here with you, and shall be content
without other society; only you’ll soon tire of me,
and leave me to some dismal governess, while you and
Guy go pleasuring.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No fear of that, Sybil; I shall hold you fast till
some younger guardian comes to rob me of my merry
ward.”</p>

<p class='c006'>As he spoke, he took the hand that lay upon his arm
into a grasp so firm, and turned on me a look so keen,
that I involuntarily dropped my eyes lest he should
read my secret there. Eager to turn the conversation,
I asked, pointing to a little miniature hanging
underneath the portrait of his son, before which he had
paused,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Was that Guy’s mother, sir?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, your own.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I looked again, and saw a face delicate yet spirited,
with dark eyes, a passionate mouth, and a head
crowned with hair as plenteous and golden as my own;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>but the whole seemed dimmed by age, the ivory was
stained, the glass cracked, and a faded ribbon fastened
it. My eyes filled as I looked, and a strong desire
seized me to know what had defaced this little picture
of the mother whom I never knew.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Tell me about her, uncle; I know so little, and
often long for her so much. Am I like her, sir?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Why did my uncle avert his eyes as he answered,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are a youthful image of her, Sybil.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Go on please, tell me more; tell me why this is so
stained and worn; you know all, and surely I am old
enough now to hear any history of pain and loss.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Something caused my uncle to knit his brows, but
his bland voice never varied a tone as he placed the
picture in my hand and gave me this brief explanation:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just before your birth your father was obliged to
cross the Channel, to receive the last wishes of a dying
friend; there was an accident; the vessel foundered,
and many lives were lost. He escaped, but by some
mistake his name appeared in the list of missing passengers;
your mother saw it, the shock destroyed her,
and when your father returned he found only a motherless
little daughter to welcome him. This miniature, which
he always carried with him, was saved with his papers
at the last moment; but though the sea-water ruined it
he would never have it copied or retouched, and gave
it to me when he died in memory of the woman I had
loved for his sake. It is yours now, my child; keep it,
and never feel that you are fatherless or motherless
while I remain.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Kind as was both act and speech, neither touched me,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>for something seemed wanting. I felt, yet could not
define it, for then I believed in the sincerity of all I
met.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where was she buried, uncle? It may be foolish,
but I should like to see my mother’s grave.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You shall some day, Sybil,” and a curious change
came over my uncle’s face as he averted it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have made him melancholy, talking of Guy’s
mother and my own; now I’ll make him gay again if
possible, and pique that negligent boy,” I thought, and
drew my uncle to a lounging-chair, established myself
on the arm thereof, and kept him laughing with my
merriest gossip, both of us apparently unconscious of
the long dark figure stretched just opposite, feigning
sleep, but watching us through half-closed lids, and
never stirring except to bow silently to my careless
“Good-night.”</p>

<p class='c006'>As I reached the stairhead, I remembered that my
letter to madame, full of the frankest criticisms upon
people and things, was lying unsealed on the table in
the little room my uncle had set apart for my boudoir;
fearing servants’ eyes and tongues, I slipped down
again to get it. The room adjoined the parlors, and
just then was lit only by a ray from the hall lamp. I
had secured the letter, and was turning to retreat, when
I heard Guy say petulantly, as if thwarted yet submissive,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“I <em>am</em> civil when you leave me alone; I <em>do</em> agree to
marry her, but I won’t be hurried or go a-wooing except
in my own way. You know I never liked the bargain, for
it’s nothing else; yet I can reconcile myself to being sold,
if it relieves you and gives us both a home. But, father,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>mind this, if you tie me to that girl’s sash too tightly
I shall break away entirely, and then where are
we?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I should be in prison and you a houseless vagabond.
Trust me, my boy, and take the good fortune which I
secured for you in your cradle. Look in pretty Sybil’s
face, and resignation will grow easy; but remember
time presses, that this is our forlorn hope, and for God’s
sake be cautious, for she is a headstrong creature, and
may refuse to fulfil her part if she learns that the contract
is not binding against her will.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think she’ll not refuse, sir; she likes me already.
I see it in her eyes; she has never had a lover, she says,
and according to your account a girl’s first sweetheart
is apt to fare the best. Besides, she likes the place, for
I told her it was hers, as you bade me, and she said
she could be very happy here, if my father was always
kind.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She said that, did she? little hypocrite! For your
father, read yourself, and tell me what else she babbled
about in that early <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>tête-à-tête</i></span> of yours.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are as curious as a woman, sir, and always make
me tell you all I do and say, yet never tell me any thing
in return, except this business, which I hate, because
my liberty is the price, and my poor little cousin is kept
in the dark. I’ll tell her all, before I marry her, father.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“As you please, hot-head. I am waiting for an account
of the first love passage, so leave blushing to
Sybil and begin.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I knew what was coming and stayed no longer, but
caught one glimpse of the pair, Guy in his favorite
place, erect upon the rug, half-laughing, half-frowning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>as he delayed to speak, my uncle serenely smoking
on the couch; then I sped away to my own room,
thinking, as I sat down in a towering passion,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“So he does know of the baby betrothal and hates it,
yet submits to please his father, who covets my fortune,—mercenary
creatures! I can annul the contract,
can I? I’m glad to know that, for it makes me mistress
of them both. I like you already, do I? and you
see it in my eyes. Coxcomb! I’ll be the thornier for
that. Yet I do like him; I do wish he cared for me,
I’m so lonely in the world, and he can be so kind.”</p>

<p class='c006'>So I cried a little, brushed my hair a good deal, and
went to bed, resolving to learn all I could when, where,
and how I pleased, to render myself as charming and
valuable as possible, to make Guy love me in spite of
himself, and then say yes or no, as my heart prompted
me.</p>

<p class='c006'>That day was a sample of those that followed, for
my cousin was by turns attracted or repelled by the
capricious moods that ruled me. Though conscious of
a secret distrust of my uncle, I could not resist the
fascination of his manner when he chose to exert its
influence over me; this made my little plot easier of
execution, for jealousy seemed the most effectual means
to bring my wayward cousin to subjection. Full of
this fancy, I seemed to tire of his society, grew thorny
as a briar rose to him, affectionate as a daughter to my
uncle, who surveyed us both with that inscrutable glance
of his, and slowly yielded to my dominion as if he had
divined my purpose and desired to aid it. Guy turned
cold and gloomy, yet still lingered near me as if ready
for a relenting look or word. I liked that, and took a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>wanton pleasure in prolonging the humiliation of the
warm heart I had learned to love, yet not to value as I
ought, until it was too late.</p>

<p class='c006'>One dull November evening as I went wandering up
and down the hall, pretending to enjoy the flowers, yet
in reality waiting for Guy, who had left me alone all day,
my uncle came from his room, where he had sat for
many hours with the harassed and anxious look he
always wore when certain foreign letters came.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sybil, I have something to show and tell you,” he
said, as I garnished his button-hole with a spray of
heliotrope, meant for the laggard, who would understand
its significance, I hoped. Leading me to the
drawing-room, my uncle put a paper into my hands,
with the request,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“This is a copy of your father’s will; oblige me by
reading it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He stood watching my face as I read, no doubt wondering
at my composure while I waded through the
dry details of the will, curbing my impatience to reach
the one important passage. There it was, but no word
concerning my power to dissolve the engagement if I
pleased; and, as I realized the fact, a sudden bewilderment
and sense of helplessness came over me, for the
strange law terms seemed to make inexorable the paternal
decree which I had not seen before. I forgot my
studied calmness, and asked several questions eagerly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Uncle, did my father really command that I should
marry Guy, whether we loved each other or not?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You see what he there set down as his desire; and
I have taken measures that you <em>should</em> love one another,
knowing that few cousins, young, comely, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>congenial, could live three months together without
finding themselves ready to mate for their own sakes,
if not for the sake of the dead and living fathers to
whom they owe obedience.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You said I need not, if I didn’t choose; why is it
not here?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I said that? Never, Sybil!” and I met a look of
such entire surprise and incredulity it staggered my
belief in my own senses, yet also roused my spirit, and,
careless of consequences, I spoke out at once,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“I heard you say it myself the night after I came,
when you told Guy to be cautious, because I could refuse
to fulfil the engagement, if I knew that it was not
binding against my will.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This discovery evidently destroyed some plan, and
for a moment threw him off his guard; for, crumpling
the paper in his hand, he sternly demanded,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“You turned eavesdropper early; how often since?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Never, uncle; I did not mean it then, but, going
for a letter in the dark, I heard your voices, and listened
for an instant. It was dishonorable, but irresistible;
and, if you force Guy’s confidence, why should
not I steal yours? All is fair in war, sir, and I forgive
as I hope to be forgiven.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You have a quick wit and a reticence I did not
expect to find under that frank manner. So you have
known your future destiny all these months, then, and
have a purpose in your treatment of your cousin and
myself?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, uncle.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“May I ask what?”</p>

<p class='c006'>I was ashamed to tell; and, in the little pause before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>my answer came, my pique at Guy’s desertion was augmented
by anger at my uncle’s denial of his own words
the ungenerous hopes he cherished, and a strong desire
to perplex and thwart him took possession of me, for
I saw his anxiety concerning the success of this interview,
though he endeavored to repress and conceal it.
Assuming my coldest mien, I said,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, sir, I think not; only I can assure you that my
little plot has succeeded better than your own.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you intend to obey your father’s wish, I hope,
and fulfil your part of the compact, Sybil?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why should I? It is not binding, you know, and
I’m too young to lose my liberty just yet; besides, such
compacts are unjust, unwise. What right had my father
to mate me in my cradle? how did he know what I
should become, or Guy? how could he tell that I should
not love some one else better? No! I’ll not be bargained
away like a piece of merchandise, but love and
marry when I please!”</p>

<p class='c006'>At this declaration of independence my uncle’s face
darkened ominously, some new suspicion lurked in his
eye, some new anxiety beset him; but his manner was
calm, his voice blander than ever as he asked,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is there then, some one whom you love? Confide
in me, my girl.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And if there were, what then?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“All would be changed at once, Sybil. But who is
it? Some young lover left behind at madame’s?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Who, then? You have led a recluse life here.
Guy has no friends who visit him, and mine are all old,
yet you say you love.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>“With all my heart, uncle.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is this affection returned, Sybil?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think so.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And it is not Guy?”</p>

<p class='c006'>I was wicked enough to enjoy the bitter disappointment
he could not conceal at my decided words,
for I thought he deserved that momentary pang; but
I could not as decidedly answer that last question,
for I would not lie, neither would I confess just yet;
so, with a little gesture of impatience, I silently turned
away, lest he should see the tell-tale color in my cheeks.
My uncle stood an instant in deep thought, a slow
smile crept to his lips, content returned to his mien,
and something like a flash of triumph glittered for a
moment in his eye, then vanished, leaving his countenance
earnestly expectant. Much as this change surprised
me, his words did more, for, taking both my
hands in his, he gravely said,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you know that I am your uncle by adoption
and not blood, Sybil?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, sir; I heard so, but forgot about it,” and I
looked up at him, my anger quite lost in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let me tell you, then. Your grandfather was
childless for many years, my mother was an early
friend, and when her death left me an orphan, he took
me for his son and heir. But two years from that time
your father was born. I was too young to realize the
entire change this might make in my life. The old
man was too just and generous to let me feel it, and
the two lads grew up together like brothers. Both
married young, and when you were born a few years
later than my son, your father said to me, ‘Your boy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>shall have my girl, and the fortune I have innocently
robbed you of shall make us happy in our children.’
Then the family league was made, renewed at his death,
and now destroyed by his daughter, unless—Sybil, I
am forty-five, you not eighteen, yet you once said you
could be very happy with me, if I were always kind to
you. I can promise that I will be, for I love you. My
darling, you reject the son, will you accept the father?”</p>

<p class='c006'>If he had struck me, it would scarcely have dismayed
me more. I started up, and snatching away my hands
hid my face in them, for after the first tingle of surprise
an almost irresistible desire to laugh came over me, but
I dared not, and gravely, gently he went on,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am a bold man to say this, yet I mean it most
sincerely. I never meant to betray the affection I believed
you never could return, and would only laugh at
as a weakness; but your past acts, your present words,
give me courage to confess that I desire to keep my
ward mine for ever. Shall it be so?”</p>

<p class='c006'>He evidently mistook my surprise for maidenly emotion,
and the suddenness of this unforeseen catastrophe
seemed to deprive me of words. All thought of merriment
or ridicule was forgotten in a sense of guilt, for if
he feigned the love he offered it was well done, and I
believed it then. I saw at once the natural impression
conveyed by my conduct; my half confession and the
folly of it all oppressed me with a regret and shame I
could not master. My mind was in dire confusion, yet
a decided “No” was rapidly emerging from the chaos,
but was not uttered; for just at this crisis, as I stood
with my uncle’s arm about me, my hand again in his,
and his head bent down to catch my answer, Guy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>swung himself gayly into the room. A glance seemed
to explain all, and in an instant his face assumed that
expression of pale wrath so much more terrible to witness
than the fiercest outbreak; his eye grew fiery, his
voice bitterly sarcastic, as he said,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah, I see; the play goes on, but the actors change
parts. I congratulate you, sir, on your success, and
Sybil on her choice. Henceforth I am <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>de trop</i></span>, but
before I go allow me to offer my wedding gift. You
have taken the bride, let me supply the ring.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He threw a jewel-box upon the table, adding, in that
unnaturally calm tone that made my heart stand still:</p>

<p class='c006'>“A little candor would have spared me much pain,
Sybil; yet I hope you will enjoy your bonds as heartily
as I shall my escape from them. A little confidence
would have made me your ally, not your rival, father.
I have not your address; therefore I lose, you win.
Let it be so. I had rather be the vagabond this makes
me than sell myself, that you may gamble away that
girl’s fortune as you have your own and mine. You
need not ask me to the wedding, I will not come. Oh,
Sybil, I so loved, so trusted you!”</p>

<p class='c006'>And with that broken exclamation he was gone.</p>

<p class='c006'>The stormy scene had passed so rapidly, been so
strange and sudden, Guy’s anger so scornful and abrupt,
I could not understand it, and felt like a puppet
in the grasp of some power I could not resist; but as
my lover left the room I broke out of the bewilderment
that held me, imploring him to stay and hear
me.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was too late, he was gone, and Sultan’s tramp was
already tearing down the avenue. I listened till the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>sound died, then my hot temper rose past control, and
womanlike asserted itself in vehement and voluble
speech: I was angry with my uncle, my cousin, and
myself, and for several minutes poured forth a torrent
of explanations, reproaches, and regrets, such as only
a passionate girl could utter.</p>

<p class='c006'>My uncle stood where I had left him when I flew to
the door with my vain cry; he now looked baffled, yet
sternly resolved, and as I paused for breath his only
answer was,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sybil, you ask me to bring back that headstrong
boy; I cannot; he will never come. This marriage
was distasteful to him, yet he submitted for my sake,
because I have been unfortunate, and we are poor.
Let him go, forget the past, and be to me what I desire,
for I loved your father and will be a faithful guardian
to his daughter all my life. Child, it must be,—come,
I implore, I command you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He beckoned imperiously as if to awe me, and held
up the glittering betrothal ring as if to tempt me. The
tone, the act, the look put me quite beside myself. I
did go to him, did take the ring, but said as resolutely
as himself,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Guy rejects me, and I have done with love. Uncle,
you would have deceived me, used me as a means to
your own selfish ends. I will accept neither yourself
nor your gifts, for now I despise both you and your
commands;” and, as the most energetic emphasis I
could give to my defiance, I flung the ring, case and
all, across the room; it struck the great mirror, shivered
it just in the middle, and sent several loosened
fragments crashing to the floor.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>“Great heavens! is the young lady mad?” exclaimed
a voice behind us. Both turned and saw Dr. Karnac,
a stealthy, sallow-faced Spaniard, for whom I had an
invincible aversion. He was my uncle’s physician,
had been visiting a sick servant in the upper regions,
and my adverse fate sent him to the door just at that
moment with that unfortunate exclamation on his
lips.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What do you say?”</p>

<p class='c006'>My uncle wheeled about and eyed the new-comer
intently as he repeated his words. I have no doubt
I looked like one demented, for I was desperately angry,
pale and trembling with excitement, and as they fronted
me with a curious expression of alarm on their faces,
a sudden sense of the absurdity of the spectacle came
over me; I laughed hysterically a moment, then broke
into a passion of regretful tears, remembering that Guy
was gone. As I sobbed behind my hands, I knew the
gentlemen were whispering together and of me, but I
never heeded them, for as I wept myself calmer a comforting
thought occurred to me; Guy could not have
gone far, for Sultan had been out all day, and though
reckless of himself he was not of his horse, which he
loved like a human being; therefore he was doubtless
at the house of an humble friend near by. If I could
slip away unseen, I might undo my miserable work, or
at least see him again before he went away into the
world, perhaps never to return. This hope gave me
courage for any thing, and dashing away my tears I
took a covert survey. Dr. Karnac and my uncle still
stood before the fire, deep in their low-toned conversation;
their backs were toward me, and, hushing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>rustle of my dress, I stole away with noiseless steps
into the hall, seized Guy’s plaid, and, opening the great
door unseen, darted down the avenue.</p>

<p class='c006'>Not far, however; the wind buffeted me to and fro,
the rain blinded me, the mud clogged my feet and soon
robbed me of a slipper; groping for it in despair, I saw
a light flash into the outer darkness; heard voices calling,
and soon the swift tramp of steps behind me.
Feeling like a hunted doe, I ran on, but before I had
gained a dozen yards my shoeless foot struck a sharp
stone, and I fell half-stunned upon the wet grass of the
wayside bank. Dr. Karnac reached me first, took me
up as if I were a naughty child, and carried me back
through a group of staring servants to the drawing-room,
my uncle following with breathless entreaties
that I would be calm, and a most uncharacteristic display
of bustle.</p>

<p class='c006'>I was horribly ashamed; my head ached with the
shock of the fall, my foot bled, my heart fluttered, and
when the doctor put me down the crisis came, for as
my uncle bent over me with the strange question, “My
poor girl, do you know me?” an irresistible impulse
impelled me to push him from me, crying passionately,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, I know and hate you; let me go! let me go,
or it will be too late!” then, quite spent with the varying
emotions of the last hour, for the first time in my
life I swooned away.</p>

<p class='c006'>Coming to myself, I found I was in my own room,
with my uncle, the doctor, Janet, and Mrs. Best, the
housekeeper, gathered about me, the latter saying, as
she bathed my temples,—</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>“She’s a sad sight, poor thing, so young, so bonny,
and so unfortunate. Did you ever see her so before,
Janet?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Bless you, no, ma’am; there was no signs of such
a tantrum when I dressed her for dinner.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What do they mean? did they never see any
one angry before?” I dimly wondered, and presently,
through the fast disappearing stupor that had held me,
Dr. Karnac’s deep voice came distinctly, saying,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“If it continues, you are perfectly justified in doing
so.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Doing what?” I demanded sharply, for the sound
both roused and irritated me, I disliked the man so
intensely.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nothing, my dear, nothing,” purred Mrs. Best, supporting
me as I sat up, feeling weak and dazed, yet
resolved to know what was going on. I was “a sad
sight” indeed; my drenched hair hung about my shoulders,
my dress was streaked with mud, one shoeless
foot was red with blood, the other splashed and stained,
and a white, wild-eyed face completed the ruinous image
the opposite mirror showed me. Every thing
looked blurred and strange, and a feverish unrest possessed
me, for I was not one to subside easily after such
a mental storm. Leaning on my arm, I scanned the
room and its occupants with all the composure I could
collect. The two women eyed me curiously yet pitifully;
Dr. Karnac stood glancing at me furtively as he
listened to my uncle, who spoke rapidly in Spanish as
he showed the little scar upon his hand. That sight
did more to restore me than the cordial just administered,
and I rose erect, saying abruptly,—</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>“Please, everybody, go away; my head aches, and I
want to be alone.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let Janet stay and help you, dear; you are
not fit,” began Mrs. Best; but I peremptorily stopped
her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, go yourself, and take her with you; I’m tired
of so much stir about such foolish things as a broken
glass and a girl in a pet.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You will be good enough to take this quieting
draught before I go, Miss Sybil.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I shall do nothing of the sort, for I need only solitude
and sleep to be perfectly well,” and I emptied the
glass the doctor offered into the fire. He shrugged his
shoulders with a disagreeable smile, and quietly began
to prepare another draught, saying,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are mistaken, my dear young lady; you need
much care, and should obey, that your uncle may be
spared further apprehension and anxiety.”</p>

<p class='c006'>My patience gave out at this assumption of authority;
and I determined to carry matters with a high hand,
for they all stood watching me in a way which seemed
the height of impertinent curiosity.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He is not my uncle! never has been, and deserves
neither respect nor obedience from me! I am the best
judge of my own health, and you are not bettering it
by contradiction and unnecessary fuss. This is my
house, and you will oblige me by leaving it, Dr. Karnac;
this is my room, and I insist on being left in peace
immediately.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I pointed to the door as I spoke; the women hurried
out with scared faces; the doctor bowed and followed,
but paused on the threshold, while my uncle approached
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>me, asking in a tone inaudible to those still hovering
round the door,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you still persist in your refusal, Sybil?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How dare you ask me that again? I tell you I had
rather die than marry you!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The Lord be merciful to us! just hear how she’s
going on now about marrying master. Ain’t it awful,
Jane?” ejaculated Mrs. Best, bobbing her head in for
a last look.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hold your tongue, you impertinent creature!” I
called out; and the fat old soul bundled away in such
comical haste I laughed, in spite of languor and vexation.</p>

<p class='c006'>My uncle left, me, and I heard him say as he passed
the doctor,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“You see how it is.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nothing uncommon; but that virulence is a bad
symptom,” answered the Spaniard, and closing the door
locked it, having dexterously removed the key from
within.</p>

<p class='c006'>I had never been subjected to restraint of any kind;
it made me reckless at once, for this last indignity was
not to be endured.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Open this instantly!” I commanded, shaking the
door. No one answered, and after a few ineffectual
attempts to break the lock I left it, threw up the window
and looked out; the ground was too far off for a
leap, but the trellis where summer-vines had clung was
strong and high, a step would place me on it, a moment’s
agility bring me to the terrace below. I was
now in just the state to attempt any rash exploit, for
the cordial had both strengthened and excited me; my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>foot was bandaged, my clothes still wet; I could suffer
no new damage, and have my own way at small cost.
Out I crept, climbed safely down, and made my way to
the lodge as I had at first intended. But Guy was not
there; and, returning, I boldly went in at the great door,
straight to the room where my uncle and the doctor
were still talking.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wish the key of my room,” was my brief command.
Both started as if I had been a ghost, and my
uncle exclaimed,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“You here! how in Heaven’s name came you out?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“By the window. I am no child to be confined for
a fit of anger. I will not submit to it; to-morrow I
shall go to madame; till then I will be mistress in my
own house. Give me the key, sir.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Shall I?” asked the doctor of my uncle, who nodded
with a whispered,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, yes; don’t excite her again.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was restored, and without another word I went
loftily up to my room, locked myself in, and spent a
restless, miserable night. When morning came, I breakfasted
above stairs, and then busied myself packing
trunks, burning papers, and collecting every trifle Guy
had ever given me. No one annoyed me, and I saw
only Janet, who had evidently received some order that
kept her silent and respectful, though her face still
betrayed the same curiosity and pitiful interest as the
night before. Lunch was brought up, but I could not
eat, and began to feel that the exposure, the fall, and
excitement of the evening had left me weak and nervous,
so I gave up the idea of going to madame till the
morrow; and, as the afternoon waned, tried to sleep, yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>could not, for I had sent a note to several of Guy’s
haunts, imploring him to see me; but my messenger
brought word that he was not to be found, and my
heart was too heavy to rest.</p>

<p class='c006'>When summoned to dinner, I still refused to go down;
for I heard Dr. Karnac’s voice, and would not meet
him, so I sent word that I wished the carriage early
the following morning, and to be left alone till then.
In a few minutes, back came Janet, with a glass of wine
set forth on a silver salver, and a card with these words,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Forgive, forget, for your father’s sake, and drink
with me, ‘Oblivion to the past.’”</p>

<p class='c006'>It touched and softened me. I knew my uncle’s
pride, and saw in this an entire relinquishment of the
hopes I had so thoughtlessly fostered in his mind. I
was passionate, but not vindictive. He had been kind,
I very wilful. His mistake was natural, my resentment
ungenerous. Though my resolution to go remained
unchanged, I was sorry for my part in the affair; and
remembering that through me his son was lost to him,
I accepted his apology, drank his toast, and sent him
back a dutiful “Good-night.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I was unused to wine. The draught I had taken was
powerful with age, and, though warm and racy to the
palate, proved too potent for me. Still sitting before
my fire, I slowly fell into a restless drowse, haunted by
a dim dream that I was seeking Guy in a ship, whose
motion gradually lulled me into perfect unconsciousness.</p>

<p class='c006'>Waking at length, I was surprised to find myself in
bed, with the shimmer of daylight peeping through the
curtains. Recollecting that I was to leave early, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>sprang up, took one step and remained transfixed with
dismay, for the room was not my own! Utterly unfamiliar
was every object on which my eyes fell. The
place was small, plainly furnished, and close, as if long
unused. My trunks stood against the wall, my clothes
lay on a chair, and on the bed I had left trailed a fur-lined
cloak I had often seen on my uncle’s shoulders.
A moment I stared about me bewildered, then hurried
to the window,—it was grated!</p>

<p class='c006'>A lawn, sere and sodden, lay without, and a line of
sombre firs hid the landscape beyond the high wall
which encompassed the dreary plot. More and more
alarmed, I flew to the door and found it locked. No
bell was visible, no sound audible, no human presence
near me, and an ominous foreboding thrilled cold
through nerves and blood, as, for the first time, I felt
the paralyzing touch of fear. Not long, however. My
native courage soon returned, indignation took the
place of terror, and excitement gave me strength. My
temples throbbed with a dull pain, my eyes were heavy,
my limbs weighed down by an unwonted lassitude, and
my memory seemed strangely confused; but one thing
was clear to me, I must see somebody, ask questions,
demand explanations, and get away to madame without
delay.</p>

<p class='c006'>With trembling hands I dressed, stopping suddenly,
with a cry; for, lifting my hands to my head, I discovered
that my hair, my beautiful, abundant hair, was
gone! There was no mirror in the room, but I could
feel that it had been shorn away close about face and
neck. This outrage was more than I could bear, and
the first tears I shed fell for my lost charm. It was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>weak, perhaps, but I felt better for it, clearer in mind
and readier to confront whatever lay before me. I
knocked and called. Then, losing patience, shook and
screamed; but no one came or answered me, and, wearied
out at last, I sat down and cried again in impotent
despair.</p>

<p class='c006'>An hour passed, then a step approached, the key
turned, and a hard-faced woman entered with a tray
in her hand. I had resolved to be patient, if possible,
and controlled myself to ask quietly, though my eyes
kindled, and my voice trembled with resentment,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where am I, and why am I here against my will?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“This is your breakfast, miss; you must be sadly
hungry,” was the only reply I got.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I will never eat till you tell me what I ask.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Will you be quiet, and mind me if I do, miss?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You have no right to exact obedience from me, but
I’ll try.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s right. Now all I know is that you are twenty
miles from the Moors, and came because you are ill.
Do you like sugar in your coffee?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“When did I come? I don’t remember it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Early this morning; you don’t remember because
you were put to sleep before being fetched, to save
trouble.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah, that wine! Who brought me here?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dr. Karnac, miss.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Alone?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, miss; you were easier to manage asleep than
awake, he said.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I shook with anger, yet still restrained myself hoping
to fathom the mystery of this nocturnal journey.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>“What is your name, please?” I meekly asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You can call me Hannah.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, Hannah, there is a strange mistake somewhere.
I am not ill—you see I am not—and I wish to go
away at once to the friend I was to meet to-day. Get
me a carriage and have my baggage taken out.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It can’t be done, miss. We are a mile from town,
and have no carriages here; besides, you couldn’t go if
I had a dozen. I have my orders, and shall obey ’em.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But Dr. Karnac has no right to bring or keep me
here.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Your uncle sent you. The doctor has the care of
you, and that is all I know about it. Now I have kept
my promise, do you keep yours, miss, and eat your
breakfast, else I can’t trust you again.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But what is the matter with me? How can I be
ill and not know or feel it?” I demanded, more and
more bewildered.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You look it, and that’s enough for them as is wise
in such matters. You’d have had a fever, if it hadn’t
been seen to in time.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Who cut my hair off?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I did; the doctor ordered it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How dared he? I hate that man, and never will
obey him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hush, miss, don’t clench your hands and look in
that way, for I shall have to report every thing you say
and do to him, and it won’t be pleasant to tell that sort
of thing.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The woman was civil, but grim and cool. Her eye
was unsympathetic, her manner business-like, her tone
such as one uses to a refractory child, half-soothing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>half-commanding. I conceived a dislike to her at once,
and resolved to escape at all hazards, for my uncle’s
inexplicable movements filled me with alarm. Hannah
had left my door open, a quick glance showed me
another door also ajar at the end of a wide hall, a
glimpse of green, and a gate. My plan was desperately
simple, and I executed it without delay. Affecting
to eat, I presently asked the woman for my handkerchief
from the bed. She crossed the room to get
it. I darted out, down the passage, along the walk,
and tugged vigorously at the great bolt of the gate,
but it was also locked. In despair I flew into the garden,
but a high wall enclosed it on every side; and as
I ran round and round, vainly looking for some outlet,
I saw Hannah, accompanied by a man as gray and
grim as herself, coming leisurely toward me, with no
appearance of excitement or displeasure. Back I would
not go; and, inspired with a sudden hope, swung myself
into one of the firs that grew close against the
wall. The branches snapped under me, the slender
tree swayed perilously, but up I struggled, till the wide
coping of the wall was gained. There I paused and
looked back. The woman was hurrying through the
gate to intercept my descent on the other side, and
close behind me the man, sternly calling me to stop.
I looked down; a stony ditch was below, but I would
rather risk my life than tamely lose my liberty, and
with a flying leap tried to reach the bank; failed, fell
heavily among the stones, felt an awful crash, and then
came an utter blank.</p>

<p class='c006'>For many weeks I lay burning in a fever, fitfully conscious
of Dr. Karnac and the woman’s presence; once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>I fancied I saw my uncle, but was never sure, and rose
at last a shadow of my former self, feeling pitifully
broken, both mentally and physically. I was in a
better room now, wintry winds howled without, but
a generous fire glowed behind the high closed fender,
and books lay on my table.</p>

<p class='c006'>I saw no one but Hannah, yet could wring no intelligence
from her beyond what she had already told, and
no sign of interest reached me from the outer world.
I seemed utterly deserted and forlorn, my spirit was
crushed, my strength gone, my freedom lost, and for a
time I succumbed to despair, letting one day follow
another without energy or hope. It is hard to live
with no object to give zest to life, especially for those
still blest with youth, and even in my prison-house I
soon found one quite in keeping with the mystery that
surrounded me.</p>

<p class='c006'>As I sat reading by day or lay awake at night, I
became aware that the room above my own was occupied
by some inmate whom I never saw. A peculiar
person it seemed to be; for I heard steps going to and
fro, hour after hour, in a tireless march, that wore upon
my nerves, as many a harsher sound would not have
done. I could neither tease nor surprise Hannah into
any explanation of the thing, and day after day I listened
to it, till I longed to cover up my ears and implore
the unknown walker to stop, for Heaven’s sake.
Other sounds I heard and fretted over: a low monotonous
murmur, as of some one singing a lullaby; a fitful
tapping, like a cradle rocked on a carpetless floor; and
at rare intervals cries of suffering, sharp but brief, as if
forcibly suppressed. These sounds, combined with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>solitude, the confinement, and the books I read, a collection
of ghostly tales and weird fancies, soon wrought
my nerves to a state of terrible irritability, and wore
upon my health so visibly that I was allowed at last to
leave my room.</p>

<p class='c006'>The house was so well guarded that I soon relinquished
all hope of escape, and listlessly amused myself
by roaming through the unfurnished rooms and echoing
halls, seldom venturing into Hannah’s domain; for there
her husband sat, surrounded by chemical apparatus,
poring over crucibles and retorts. He never spoke to
me, and I dreaded the glance of his cold eye, for it
looked unsoftened by a ray of pity at the little figure
that sometimes paused a moment on his threshold,
wan and wasted as the ghost of departed hope.</p>

<p class='c006'>The chief interest of these dreary walks centred in
the door of the room above my own, for a great hound
lay before it, eying me savagely as he rejected all advances,
and uttering his deep bay if I approached too
near. To me this room possessed an irresistible fascination.
I could not keep away from it by day, I dreamed
of it by night, it haunted me continually, and soon
became a sort of monomania, which I condemned, yet
could not control, till at length I found myself pacing
to and fro as those invisible feet paced over head.
Hannah came and stopped me, and a few hours later
Dr. Karnac appeared. I was so changed that I feared
him with a deadly fear. He seemed to enjoy it; for
in the pride of youth and beauty I had shown him
contempt and defiance at my uncle’s, and he took an
ungenerous satisfaction in annoying me by a display
of power. He never answered my questions or entreaties,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>regarded me as being without sense or will,
insisted on my trying various mixtures and experiments
in diet, gave me strange books to read, and
weekly received Hannah’s report of all that passed.
That day he came, looked at me, said, “Let her walk,”
and went away, smiling that hateful smile of his.</p>

<p class='c006'>Soon after this I took to walking in my sleep, and
more than once woke to find myself roving lampless
through that haunted house in the dead of night. I
concealed these unconscious wanderings for a time, but
an ominous event broke them up at last, and betrayed
them to Hannah.</p>

<p class='c006'>I had followed the steps one day for several hours,
walking below as they walked above; had peopled that
mysterious room with every mournful shape my disordered
fancy could conjure up; had woven tragical
romances about it, and brooded over the one subject of
interest my unnatural life possessed with the intensity
of a mind upon which its uncanny influence was telling
with perilous rapidity. At midnight I woke to find
myself standing in a streak of moonlight, opposite the
door whose threshold I had never crossed. The April
night was warm, a single pane of glass high up in that
closed door was drawn aside, as if for air; and, as I stood
dreamily collecting my sleep-drunken senses, I saw a
ghostly hand emerge and beckon, as if to me. It
startled me broad awake, with a faint exclamation and
a shudder from head to foot. A cloud swept over the
moon, and when it passed the hand was gone, but shrill
through the keyhole came a whisper that chilled me
to the marrow of my bones, so terribly distinct and
imploring was it.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>“Find it! for God’s sake find it before it is too
late!”</p>

<p class='c006'>The hound sprang up with an angry growl; I heard
Hannah leave her bed near by, and, with an inspiration
strange as the moment, I paced slowly on with open
eyes and lips apart, as I had seen “Amina” in the
happy days when kind old madame took me to the
theatre, whose mimic horrors I had never thought to
equal with such veritable ones. Hannah appeared at
her door with a light, but on I went in a trance of
fear; for I was only kept from dropping in a swoon
by the blind longing to fly from that spectral voice and
hand. Past Hannah I went, she following; and, as
I slowly laid myself in bed, I heard her say to her husband,
who just then came up,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sleep-walking, John; it’s getting worse and worse,
as the doctor foretold; she’ll settle down like the other
presently, but she must be locked up at night, else the
dog will do her a mischief.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The man yawned and grumbled; then they went,
leaving me to spend hours of unspeakable suffering,
which aged me more than years. What was I to find?
where was I to look? and when would it be too late?
These questions tormented me; for I could find no
answers to them, divine no meaning, see no course to
pursue. Why was I here? what motive induced my
uncle to commit such an act? and when should I be
liberated? were equally unanswerable, equally tormenting,
and they haunted me like ghosts. I had no power
to exorcise or forget. After that I walked no more,
because I slept no more; sleep seemed scared away,
and waking dreams harassed me with their terrors.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>Night after night I paced my room in utter darkness,—for
I was allowed no lamp,—night after night I
wept bitter tears wrung from me by anguish, for which
I had no name; and night after night the steps kept
time to mine, and the faint lullaby came down to me
as if to soothe and comfort my distress. I felt that
my health was going, my mind growing confused and
weak, my thoughts wandered vaguely, memory began
to fail, and idiocy or madness seemed my inevitable
fate; but through it all my heart clung to Guy, yearning
for him with a hunger that would not be appeased.</p>

<p class='c006'>At rare intervals I was allowed to walk in the neglected
garden, where no flowers bloomed, no birds
sang, no companion came to me but surly John, who
followed with his book or pipe, stopping when I stopped,
walking when I walked, keeping a vigilant eye upon
me, yet seldom speaking except to decline answering
my questions. These walks did me no good, for the
air was damp and heavy with vapors from the marsh;
for the house stood near a half-dried lake, and hills
shut it in on every side. No fresh winds from upland
moor or distant ocean ever blew across the narrow valley;
no human creature visited the place, and nothing
but a vague hope that my birthday might bring some
change, some help, sustained me. It did bring help,
but of such an unexpected sort that its effects remained
through all my after-life. My birthday came, and with
it my uncle. I was in my room, walking restlessly,—for
the habit was a confirmed one now,—when the
door opened, and Hannah, Dr. Karnac, my uncle, and
a gentleman whom I knew to be his lawyer, entered,
and surveyed me as if I were a spectacle. I saw my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>uncle start and turn pale; I had never seen myself
since I came, but, if I had not suspected that I was
a melancholy wreck of my former self, I should have
known it then, such sudden pain and pity softened his
ruthless countenance for a single instant. Dr. Karnac’s
eye had a magnetic power over me; I had always felt
it, but in my present feeble state I dreaded, yet submitted
to it with a helpless fear that should have
touched his heart,—it was on me then, I could not
resist it, and paused fixed and fascinated by that repellent
yet potent glance. Hannah pointed to the carpet
worn to shreds by my weary march, to the walls which
I had covered with weird, grotesque, or tragic figures
to while away the heavy hours, lastly to myself, mute,
motionless, and scared, saying, as if in confirmation of
some previous assertion,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“You see, gentlemen, she is, as I said, quiet, but quite
hopeless.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I thought she was interceding for me; and, breaking
from the bewilderment and fear that held me, I
stretched my hands to them, crying with an imploring
cry,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, I <em>am</em> quiet! I <em>am</em> hopeless! Oh, have pity
on me before this dreadful life kills me or drives me
mad!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Karnac came to me at once with a black frown,
which I alone could see; I evaded him, and clung to
Hannah, still crying frantically,—for this seemed my
last hope,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Uncle, let me go! I will give you all I have, will
never ask for Guy, will be obedient and meek if I may
only go to madame and never hear the feet again, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>see the sights that terrify me in this dreadful room.
Take me out! for God’s sake take me out!”</p>

<p class='c006'>My uncle did not answer me, but covered up his face
with a despairing gesture, and hurried from the room;
the lawyer followed, muttering pitifully, “Poor thing!
poor thing!” and Dr. Karnac laughed the first laugh
I had ever heard him utter as he wrenched Hannah
from my grasp and locked me in alone. My one hope
died then, and I resolved to kill myself rather than
endure this life another month; for now it grew clear
to me that they believed me mad, and death of the
body was far more preferable than that of the mind. I
think I <em>was</em> a little mad just then, but remember well
the sense of peace that came to me as I tore strips from
my clothing, braided them into a cord, hid it beneath
my mattress, and serenely waited for the night. Sitting
in the last twilight I thought to see in this unhappy
world, I recollected that I had not heard the
feet all day, and fell to pondering over the unusual
omission. But, if the steps had been silent in that
room, voices had not, for I heard a continuous murmur
at one time: the tones of one voice were abrupt and
broken, the other low, yet resonant, and that, I felt
assured, belonged to my uncle. Who was he speaking
to? what were they saying? should I ever know? and
even then, with death before me, the intense desire to
possess the secret filled me with its old unrest.</p>

<p class='c006'>Night came at last; I heard the clock strike one, and,
listening to discover if John still lingered up, I heard
through the deep hush a soft grating in the room
above, a stealthy sound that would have escaped ears
less preternaturally alert than mine. Like a flash came
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>the thought, “Some one is filing bars or picking locks:
will the unknown remember me and let me share her
flight?” The fatal noose hung ready, but I no longer
cared to use it, for hope had come to nerve me with
the strength and courage I had lost. Breathlessly I
listened; the sound went on, stopped, a dead silence
reigned; then something brushed against my door,
and, with a suddenness that made me tingle from head
to foot like an electric shock, through the keyhole
came again that whisper, urgent, imploring, and mysterious,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Find it! for God’s sake find it before it is too
late!” then fainter, as if breath failed, came the broken
words, “The dog—a lock of hair—there is yet time.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Eagerness rendered me forgetful of the secrecy I
should preserve, and I cried aloud, “What shall I find?
where shall I look?” My voice, sharpened by fear,
rang shrilly through the house, Hannah’s quick tread
rushed down the hall, something fell, then loud and
long rose a cry that made my heart stand still, so helpless,
so hopeless was its wild lament. I had betrayed
and I could not save or comfort the kind soul who had
lost liberty through me. I was frantic to get out, and
beat upon my door in a paroxysm of impatience, but
no one came; and all night long those awful cries
went on above, cries of mortal anguish, as if soul and
body were being torn asunder. Till dawn I listened,
pent in that room which now possessed an added
terror; till dawn I called, wept, and prayed, with mingled
pity, fear, and penitence, and till dawn the agony
of that unknown sufferer continued unabated. I heard
John hurry to and fro, heard Hannah issue orders with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>an accent of human sympathy in her hard voice; heard
Dr. Karnac pass and repass my door, and all the sounds
of confusion and alarm in that once quiet house. With
daylight all was still, a stillness more terrible than the
stir; for it fell so suddenly, remained so utterly unbroken,
that there seemed no explanation of it but the
dread word death.</p>

<p class='c006'>At noon Hannah, a shade paler, but grim as ever,
brought me some food, saying she forgot my breakfast,
and when I refused to eat, yet asked no questions, she
bade me go into the garden and not fret myself over
last night’s flurry. I went, and, passing down the corridor,
glanced furtively at the door I never saw without
a thrill; but I experienced a new sensation then, for
the hound was gone, the door was open, and, with an
impulse past control, I crept in and looked about me.
It was a room like mine, the carpet worn like mine,
the windows barred like mine; there the resemblance
ended, for an empty cradle stood beside the bed, and
on that bed, below a sweeping cover, stark and still a
lifeless body lay. I was inured to fear now, and an
unwholesome craving for new terrors seemed to have
grown by what it fed on: an irresistible desire led me
close, nerved me to lift the cover and look below,—a
single glance,—then, with a cry as panic-stricken as
that which rent the silence of the night, I fled away,
for the face I saw was a pale image of my own. Sharpened
by suffering, pallid with death, the features were
familiar as those I used to see; the hair, beautiful and
blonde as mine had been, streamed long over the pulseless
breast, and on the hand, still clenched in that last
struggle, shone the likeness of a ring I wore, a ring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>bequeathed me by my father. An awesome fancy that
it was myself assailed me; I had plotted death, and,
with the waywardness of a shattered mind, I recalled
legends of spirits returning to behold the bodies they
had left.</p>

<p class='c006'>Glad now to seek the garden, I hurried down, but on
the threshold of the great hall-door was arrested by
the sharp crack of a pistol; and, as a little cloud of
smoke dispersed, I saw John drop the weapon and
approach the hound, who lay writhing on the bloody
grass. Moved by compassion for the faithful brute
whose long vigilance was so cruelly repaid, I went to
him, and, kneeling there, caressed the great head that
never yielded to my touch before. John assumed his
watch at once, and leaning against a tree cleaned the
pistol, content that I should amuse myself with the
dying creature, who looked into my face with eyes of
almost human pathos and reproach. The brass collar
seemed to choke him as he gasped for breath, and, leaning
nearer to undo it, I saw, half hidden in his own
black hair, a golden lock wound tightly round the
collar, and so near its color as to be unobservable,
except upon a close inspection. No accident could
have placed it there; no head but mine in that house
wore hair of that sunny hue,—yes, one other, and my
heart gave a sudden leap as I remembered the shining
locks just seen on that still bosom.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Find it—the dog—the lock of hair,” rung in my
ears, and swift as light came the conviction that the
unknown help was found at last. The little band was
woven close, I had no knife, delay was fatal, I bent my
head as if lamenting over the poor beast and bit the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>knot apart, drew out a folded paper, hid it in my hand,
and rising strolled leisurely back to my own room,
saying I did not care to walk till it was warmer. With
eager eyes I examined my strange treasure-trove; it
consisted of two strips of thinnest paper, without
address or signature, one almost illegible, worn at the
edges and stained with the green rust of the collar;
the other fresher, yet more feebly written, both abrupt
and disjointed, but terribly significant to me. This
was the first,—</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have never seen you, never heard your name, yet I know
that you are young, that you are suffering, and I try to help you
in my poor way. I think you are not crazed yet, as I often am;
for your voice is sane, your plaintive singing not like mine, your
walking only caught from me, I hope. I sing to lull the baby
whom I never saw; I walk to lessen the long journey that will
bring me to the husband I have lost,—stop! I must not think of
those things or I shall forget. If you are not already mad, you
will be; I suspect you were sent here to be made so; for the air
is poison, the solitude is fatal, and Karnac remorseless in his
mania for prying into the mysteries of human minds. What
devil sent you I may never know, but I long to warn you. I can
devise no way but this; the dog comes into my room sometimes,
you sometimes pause at my door and talk to him; you may find
the paper I shall hide about his collar. Read, destroy, but obey
it. I implore you to leave this house before it is too late.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The other paper was as follows:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have watched you, tried to tell you where to look, for you
have not found my warning yet, though I often tie it there and
hope. You fear the dog, perhaps, and my plot fails; yet I know
by your altered step and voice that you are fast reaching my
unhappy state; for I am fitfully mad, and shall be till I die.
To-day I have seen a familiar face; it seems to have calmed
and strengthened me, and, though he would not help you, I shall
make one desperate attempt. I may not find you, so leave my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>warning to the hound, yet hope to breathe a word into your sleepless
ear that shall send you back into the world the happy thing
you should be. Child! woman! whatever you are, leave this
accursed house while you have power to do it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>That was all; I did not destroy the papers, but I
obeyed them, and for a week watched and waited till
the propitious instant came. I saw my uncle, the doctor,
and two others, follow the poor body to its grave
beside the lake, saw all depart but Dr. Karnac, and felt
redoubled hatred and contempt for the men who could
repay my girlish slights with such a horrible revenge.
On the seventh day, as I went down for my daily walk,
I saw John and Dr. Karnac so deep in some uncanny
experiment that I passed out unguarded. Hoping to
profit by this unexpected chance, I sprang down the
steps, but the next moment dropped half-stunned upon
the grass; for behind me rose a crash, a shriek, a sudden
blaze that flashed up and spread, sending a noisome
vapor rolling out with clouds of smoke and flame.
Aghast, I was just gathering myself up, when Hannah
fled out of the house, dragging her husband senseless
and bleeding, while her own face was ashy with
affright. She dropped her burden beside me, saying,
with white lips and a vain look for help where help
was not,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Something they were at has burst, killed the doctor,
and fired the house! Watch John till I get help,
and leave him at your peril!” then flinging open the
gate she sped away.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now is my time,” I thought, and only waiting till
she vanished, I boldly followed her example, running
rapidly along the road in an opposite direction, careless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>of bonnetless head and trembling limbs, intent only
upon leaving that prison-house far behind me. For
several hours I hurried along that solitary road; the
spring sun shone, birds sang in the blooming hedges,
green nooks invited me to pause and rest, but I heeded
none of them, steadily continuing my flight, till spent
and footsore I was forced to stop a moment by a wayside
spring. As I stooped to drink, I saw my face for
the first time in many months, and started to see how
like that dead one it had grown, in all but the eternal
peace which made that beautiful in spite of suffering
and age. Standing thus and wondering if Guy would
know me, should we ever meet, the sound of wheels
disturbed me. Believing them to be coming from the
place I had left, I ran desperately down the hill, turned
a sharp corner, and before I could check myself passed
a carriage slowly ascending. A face sprang to the
window, a voice cried “Stop!” but on I flew, hoping
the traveller would let me go unpursued. Not so,
however; soon I heard fleet steps following, gaining
rapidly, then a hand seized me, a voice rang in my
ears, and with a vain struggle I lay panting in my
captor’s hold, fearing to look up and meet a brutal
glance. But the hand that had seized me tenderly
drew me close, the voice that had alarmed cried joyfully,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sybil, it is Guy! lie still, poor child, you are safe at
last.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Then I knew that my surest refuge was gained, and,
too weak for words, clung to him in an agony of happiness,
which brought to his kind eyes the tears I could
not shed.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>The carriage returned; Guy took me in, and for a
time cared only to soothe and sustain my worn soul
and body with the cordial of his presence, as we rolled
homeward through a blooming world, whose beauty I
had never truly felt before. When the first tumult
of emotion had subsided, I told the story of my captivity
and my escape, ending with a passionate entreaty
not to be returned to my uncle’s keeping, for
henceforth there could be neither affection nor respect
between us.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Fear nothing, Sybil; madame is waiting for you at
the Moors, and my father’s unfaithful guardianship has
ended with his life.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Then with averted face and broken voice Guy went
on to tell his father’s purposes, and what had caused
this unexpected meeting. The facts were briefly these:
The knowledge that my father had come between him
and a princely fortune had always rankled in my
uncle’s heart, chilling the ambitious hopes he cherished
even in his boyhood, and making life an eager search
for pleasure in which to drown his vain regrets. This
secret was suspected by my father, and the household
league was formed as some atonement for the innocent
offence. It seemed to soothe my uncle’s resentful
nature, and as years went on he lived freely, assured
that ample means would be his through his son. Luxurious,
self-indulgent, fond of all excitements, and reckless
in their pursuit, he took no thought for the morrow
till a few months before his return. A gay winter in
Paris reduced him to those straits of which women
know so little; creditors were oppressive, summer
friends failed him, gambling debts harassed him, his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>son reproached him, and but one resource remained,
Guy’s speedy marriage with the half-forgotten heiress.
The boy had been educated to regard this fate as a
fixed fact, and submitted, believing the time to be far
distant; but the sudden summons came, and he rebelled
against it, preferring liberty to love. My uncle
pacified the claimants by promises to be fulfilled at my
expense, and hurried home to press on the marriage,
which now seemed imperative. I was taken to my
future home, approved by my uncle, beloved by my
cousin, and, but for my own folly, might have been a
happy wife on that May morning when I listened to
this unveiling of the past. My mother had been melancholy
mad since that unhappy rumor of my father’s
death; this affliction had been well concealed from me,
lest the knowledge should prey upon my excitable
nature and perhaps induce a like misfortune. I believed
her dead, yet I had seen her, knew where her
solitary grave was made, and still carried in my bosom
the warning she had sent me, prompted by the unerring
instinct of a mother’s heart. In my father’s will a
clause was added just below the one confirming my
betrothal, a clause decreeing that, if it should appear
that I inherited my mother’s malady, the fortune
should revert to my cousin, with myself a mournful
legacy, to be cherished by him whether his wife or not.
This passage, and that relating to my freedom of
choice, had been omitted in the copy shown me on the
night when my seeming refusal of Guy had induced
his father to believe that I loved him, to make a last
attempt to keep the prize by offering himself, and,
when that failed, to harbor a design that changed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>my little comedy into the tragical experience I have
told.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Karnac’s exclamation had caused the recollection
of that clause respecting my insanity to flash into
my uncle’s mind,—a mind as quick to conceive as fearless
to execute. I unconsciously abetted the stratagem,
and Dr. Karnac was an unscrupulous ally, for love
of gain was as strong as love of science; both were
amply gratified, and I, poor victim, was given up to be
experimented upon, till by subtle means I was driven
to the insanity which would give my uncle full control
of my fortune and my fate. How the black plot prospered
has been told; but retribution speedily overtook
them both, for Dr. Karnac paid his penalty by the sudden
death that left his ashes among the blackened ruins
of that house of horrors, and my uncle had preceded
him. For before the change of heirs could be effected
my mother died, and the hours spent in that unhealthful
spot insinuated the subtle poison of the marsh into
his blood; years of pleasure left little vigor to withstand
the fever, and a week of suffering ended a life of
generous impulses perverted, fine endowments wasted,
and opportunities for ever lost. When death drew
near, he sent for Guy (who, through the hard discipline
of poverty and honest labor, was becoming a manlier
man), confessed all, and implored him to save me
before it was too late. He did, and when all was told,
when each saw the other by the light of this strange
and sad experience,—Guy poor again, I free, the old
bond still existing, the barrier of misunderstanding
gone,—it was easy to see our way, easy to submit, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>forgive, forget, and begin anew the life these clouds had
darkened for a time.</p>

<p class='c006'>Home received me, kind madame welcomed me, Guy
married me, and I was happy; but over all these years,
serenely prosperous, still hangs for me the shadow of
the past, still rises that dead image of my mother, still
echoes that spectral whisper in the dark.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
